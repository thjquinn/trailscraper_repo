22.9,Loop,861,409,3374,3370,6,27,The Adventure Hiking Trail Loop,Intermediate/Difficult,4.3,"        The trail is rough, rugged, and rutted in places, with a number of steep climbs and descents. Fallen trees, logs, and loose rock may be encountered at any time, as the trail receives minimal maintenance. 

The trail is marked with white and green markers. Some markers can be difficult to locate, especially in places where trees have fallen.

Beginning in the campground, near the entrance to the Horseman's Camp loop, follow the gravel access trail a short distance down to the Adventure Hiking Trail intersection on the right. 

The trail descends approximately one mile toward the Blue River, crossing the Breeden Ridge Trail, before dropping into the river valley and crossing the old Iron Bridge Road. (The trail runs through the bottom lands near the Blue River, and the area can be wet or closed during high water events.)

Following the edge of the Blue River for a mile or so, the trail climbs back up the ridges and crosses the Fire Tower Trail in two locations before descending again toward Fox Hollow, eventually climbing back up the hills for a view of the Blue River, near the trail intersection at Rendezvous Point. Just across the river is the old Stagecoach Campground.

The trail continues across a series of ridges and valleys for about 3 miles and after another descent, the trail climbs once again as it nears IN-462, and crosses that road a short distance from the O'Bannon Woods State Park entrance.

After crossing IN-462, the trail winds through a swampy area, and then once again descends through a rocky segment following a dry creek bed, before climbing again. The trail continues to twist and wind, with a number of shorter climbs and descents before a long climb to the Old Forest Road crossing. It's about 2 miles from crossing to crossing.

From Old Forest Road, the trail drops and climbs again, and joins a horse trail for a short segment along a ridge line. The trail breaks off and continues to wind through the woods before reaching the steep limestone bluffs that overlook Indian Creek far below. The trail follows along the edge of the bluff closely, before reaching the Indian Creek Shelter a short distance later.

From the Indian Creek Shelter, the trail descends and climbs a number of times, through rocky creek beds and up short hills, approximately 3.5 miles before reaching the Old Homestead Shelter.

Another series of short climbs is followed by long descent to the Cold Friday Road crossing, about 1.5 miles from the Old Homestead Shelter. The Cold Friday Road crossing is an excellent place to cache supplies, or leave a vehicle in case of an emergency.

From Cold Friday Road, the trail climbs up a steep rocky hillside, and makes a steep descent into a dry creek bed, before climbing steeply once again up a sharp switchback step. Following along the edge of another ridge, the trail descends and climbs once more, before reaching a long, scenic section that runs along the edge of the bluffs overlooking the Ohio River. The trail joins a horse trail for a short distance before reaching the Ohio River Overlook Shelter. It's about 2.8 miles from Cold Friday to the shelter.

From the Overlook Shelter, the trail makes a twisty mile-long descent toward Potato Run Creek and follows along a steep bank overlooking the creek. The trail crosses Potato Run Creek near the Pioneer Shelter and crosses the paved park road, climbing up a steep bank on the opposite side over a series of water bars.

The trail continues to climb the ridge and twists and winds through a series of short descents and climbs before eventually crossing the Breeden Ridge Trail. After crossing Breeden Ridge, the campground is a short distance away, with the trail joining the gravel access trail the hike began on.

5.7,Loop,662,573,247,246,2,12,Perimeter Loop,Intermediate,5.0,"        This is GBP's longest loop; follow the red shield ""Perimeter Loop"" blazes. Starting near the main parking area, the trail heads north through the forest before reaching a climb; the trail follows a wider trail NW along the lake. The trail turns north to a long section punctuated by switchbacks; a climb brings hikers to one of the park's tallest hills. 

After a descent, cross a bridge and then turn left. Follow along a pond, cross bridges and a short cobblestone section and then meander through the woods. After crossing another bridge, the trail passes over a few undulating bumps and then climbs out to a right turn. 

Here the Perimeter Loop joins the doubletrack dirt Moore Road that is followed for about a mile to a singletrack trail situated along the park's southern boundary. Take in gorgeous views of Stryker Lake before reaching the SW parking lot. The trail continues across the lot and follows short ridges with dips in-between. The trail then straightens out and leads to some switchbacks before ending near the main parking area.

This is a very popular area for mountains bikers. Be aware of your surroundings and of other users on the trail.

2.0,Loop,670,507,229,226,4,25,Trail 4,Difficult,5.0,"Trail 4 can be accessed from a few spots throughout the park. For our hike we took Trail 1 from behind the Spring Mill Inn to reach Trail 4. You can also access the trail from the parking area near the Pioneer Village. 

The trail takes you to many historical elements of the park. The Pioneer Village is a historical recreation of what life was like in this area in the 1800's. Log cabins and the working grist mill our manned by interpreters are open for you to explore. Upon approaching the Pioneer Village, you'll have two choices to continue your hike. One portion of the trail will take you thorough the village, and the other way takes you around the village. NO DOGS are allowed in the village, so plan accordingly. 

Just past the Pioneer Village, you'll pass Hamer Cave and eventually come across the Hamer Pioneer Cemetery. The path follows the back side of the cemetery along the fence. You'll need to work your way around to the front to access the cemetery if you wish to explore there. Be on the look out for grave markers identifying servicemen who fought and died for our country.

After the cemetery, you'll cross through a parking and picnic area and descend a long series of wooden steps taking you down to the creek. From here you can turn right for a very short spurt to Donaldson Cave. Turning left at the bottom of the steps completes the loop and takes you past the Wilson Monument honoring Andrew Wilson an early American ornithologist. The monument was erected in 1866 by George Donaldson, the former land owner.

You'll come across many hills and valleys and will be met with many rock formations that you'll need to work around on this trail. The park map calls this trail ""rugged"" and it lives up to it's classification.

1.8,Point to Point,668,542,311,259,6,21,Trail #2,Difficult,5.0,"        Most people park at either Newby Gulch shelter or the Nature Center for this trail. When parking at the Nature Center, take the 70 Steps Connector down to the bottom of the canyon. Turn left on Trail #1 until Trail #2 branches to the right.

Once on Trail #2, you'll enter Box Canyon, one of the most underrated canyons at Turkey Run. This canyon feels like trekking through a tropical rainforest in the summertime and is worth checking out. The trail climbs a stone staircase carved into the rock and is truly a sight to see. At the top, multiple pathways emerge and it can be difficult to determine which one is the trail. Continue straight, and the trail should become narrow again and bank to the right.

The trail now follows the canyon rim and dips down into the valley where it hugs the rock wall. Eventually you'll come to Gypsy Gulch, another underrated landmark at Turkey Run. The trail continues to hug the wall here, and sometimes a waterfall will form in the middle of the gulch which can be walked behind. After passing the gulch, the trail passes more interesting sandstone cliffs before meeting the Lusk Earth Fill Connector. Turn right and follow Trail #2.

The rest of the trail is pretty flat and traverses forest and a road before passing Canyon Shelter, some picnic areas, and some parking. The trail returns to the rock staircase, completing the loop. This trail is typically less trafficked, making it a nice trail to get away from the crowds at Turkey Run.

I recommend this trail to everyone who pays a visit to Turkey Run State Park and I highly suggest trying this trail in the evening when the canyon gets cold and the crowds go away.

The start of this trail is behind the cabins near the Turkey Run Inn. After passing the cabins, the trail heads down into Turkey Run Hollow. Passing under the Old Highway Bridge, the trail follows the creek around a bend traversing boulders and small caves. About halfway, the trail meets with Trail #7, which is another underused but fantastic trail at Turkey Run. Trail #7 turns left, while Trail #6 continues to the right.

After crossing a bridge, the trail splits and goes to a small beach along Sugar Creek. Swimming is not allowed here, but it is a nice secluded spot to watch the river. Turning to the right, the trail continues by climbing up to Sunset Point, overlooking Sugar Creek from above. Nearby is the Lieber Cabin, which typically houses a few historical exhibits about the park and the area. Trail #6 finishes behind Turkey Run Inn.

The trail starts with a smooth, downhill, curvy segment weaving through a large hardwood forest, with numerous creek crossings and drains to be aware of. As the trail approaches the bluffs overlooking the Blue River, users will encounter more rocky conditions before arriving at a short rock feature that spans a wet area along the steep cliff side. This attention-demanding segment of the trail continues along the edge of the bluff for a short distance before reaching another smoother, easier section. A side trail on the right leads to a scenic overlook.

After a gradual climb to the Iron Bridge Road crossing, the trail continues to twist and turn and descends into a series of curves, toward a wooden bridge and an intersection with the Rocky Ridge Loop. Proceeding up the left fork at the intersection, Fire Tower Trail leads to the campground, the Potato Run Trail and the Breeden Ridge Trail, while a right turn will lead into the Rocky Ridge Loop. 

The trail twists and winds through another section of rocky limestone outcroppings before climbing to the other intersection with the Rocky Ridge Loop. Proceeding left at the fork, Fire Tower Trail continues to climb toward the campground, where water and restrooms are available. 

The Potato Run Trail is accessed by hiking a short distance to the left up one of the campground roads. The entrance is near the ice machine, by the campground gatehouse.

2.0,Point to Point,741,576,43,166,2,7,Rocky Ridge Loop,Difficult,5.0,"        The Rocky Ridge Loop joins the Fire Tower Trail in two locations. Traveling downhill from the Fire Tower, the first intersection is just a short distance past the wooden bridge. 

At the signpost where the Fire Tower Trail meets the Rocky Ridge Loop, taking a right at the intersection will lead down Rocky Ridge, toward a rugged, rocky, rooted section, before descending into the neighboring ravine, crossing a typically dry creek bed. After a long climb, the entrance to the Breeden Ridge Trail will be on the right.

Taking the fork to the left, the Fire Tower Trail slowly climbs toward the Class A campground, through a scenic, rocky segment, where large limestone boulders line the edges of the pathway. 

At the next intersection, water and restrooms are available in the campground by taking the left fork, continuing up the Fire Tower Trail. Taking the right fork, following Rocky Ridge, the trail will lead to the Breeden Ridge intersection. 

After a short downhill and crossing a wooden bridge, the trail begins a long rolling descent through the woods. Part way down the trail, a fork to the left will lead to the Breeden Ridge Trail.

The Group Camp Trail begins by weaving through the fallen pines, with poison ivy all along the edges. The hand-cut trail follows along the edge of a gentle ridge, past the raspberries and log hops, before crossing a horse trail. 

After crossing the horse trail, the Group Camp Trail begins to descend into a rugged, rocky, challenging section that follows along the edge of a deep ravine. The trail makes a turn just after a dry creek crossing, crosses a cobblestone minefield and continues along the ravine, past many limestone outcroppings, through a series of switchbacks and along a rocky, rooted segment, before reaching the Group Camp area. 

The trail winds through the woods, through a series of rollers around the Group Camp, before ending at the paved road. The entrance to the Potato Run Trail is just across the road.

Starting near the 56th Street entrance and moving to the east, the trail takes you toward the Indianapolis Rowing Club HQ. From there, you traverse a small peninsula before moving back into the woods and passing the Earth Discovery Center (a wonderful stop of educational opportunities and exploration!) From there, the trail takes you toward the marina. 

The next part of the trail is really exciting with a modestly steep drop in elevation before you head out on a narrow strip of land that surrounds a bird sanctuary. Lots of people like to hang out on this strip of land to fish. Sometimes the water level is so high that the southern strip of land can be nearly submerged. Once you complete the loop around the Bird Sanctuary, the trail climbs in elevation to the top of a BEAUTIFUL overlook through a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees. at this point, you start to turn to the southeast and head toward the 71st Street entrance. At this gate, there is a restroom should you need a break. 

From here, the trail takes you along the fitness trail (large/wide/flat) before swinging by the Ornithology Center. Stop by to take a look at the gorgeous hawks! Then, the trail takes you to Lily Lake (great picnic spot) with another restroom opportunity. Moving south, you'll cross 62nd Street and head toward the ice skating pond. Just south of the pond, you'll go back into a deeper wooded area near the main road that runs north-south through the park (Eagle Creek Parkway).

If you want to hike this loop by itself from the main trailhead, the total round-trip distance is 2.4 miles. You'll start and end the hike using a portion of the West Beach Trail. 

The footing is mainly loose sand. This area is being restored as an oak savanna and is a great place to see prickly pear cactus. The trail follows along Long Lake and then heads into the dunes. There is a great view of long lake after the initial climb. After crossing the entrance road, the trail winds through the undulating dunes and then has a steep climb down an exposed dune to the picnic area.

The trail is not accessible to wheelchairs. However, there is a paved road from the parking lot to the bathhouse that offers views of Lake Michigan that is accessible to wheelchairs. The main parking lot has spots for 596 cars and is open year round. 

There are restroom facilities and potable water available year round in the West Beach Contact Station. Seasonal showers, lockers and a beach (with lifeguards) are available in the summer. 

Indiana Dunes National Park (formerly national lakeshore) was established to preserve portions of the Indiana Dunes and other areas of scenic, scientific, historic and recreational value. Up to two million annual visitors enjoy the park's 15,000 acres of wetlands, prairies, sand dunes, oak savannas, forests, and historic sites. The park's 15 miles of beaches hug the southern shore of Lake Michigan from Gary, IN, to Michigan City, IN. For more information, visit  nps.gov/indu/index.htm or  facebook.com/IndianaDunesNPS.

About halfway through Trail 5, you'll see a sign that points you one of two directions: to Trail 4 or to continue with 5. We continued and did the loop at the end. This is a great area for those who like seclusion; it was a grown up area that had us feeling like we were deep into the forest. If you're just going down Trail 5, there are about 100 stairs, if you're going down and back up, get ready for 200! That's why this trail is rated Difficult, even though the distance is just about 1 mile.

The trail begins at the Pioneer Shelter and crosses Potato Run Creek, which is usually dry. Follow along Potato Run and climb up, following along the steep-sided bank overlooking Potato Run Creek. 

The Cliff Dweller Trail forks off to the left after a rugged climb, but local hikers typically tie Cliff Dweller into a hike up to the Ohio River Overlook Shelter (AKA Lloyd's Cabin), on The Adventure Hiking Trail Loop for a great view of the Ohio River, before returning to the trail intersection.

The descent from the intersection crosses a number of rocky ravines before dropping through the cedars. Use caution on the descent, as the trail drops off sharply over a rocky outcropping, followed by a hard left turn. The trail then follows along a rocky creek bed, climbing and descending another rocky outcropping before returning to the Potato Run crossing. Follow the trail up the hill, back to Pioneer Cabin.

Breeden Ridge begins with a classic hand-built segment leading into a rocky section with a number of optional lines. Past the rocks, the new machine built trail begins, with a rolling climb to the top of Breeden Ridge. A stair-step segment through the rocks leads toward the top of the ridge.

Once at the top of the ridge, the trail twists, and winds, with a number of berms and rollers, and descends through a challenging, rocky staircase toward more berms, rollers, and rock features. The trail climbs toward a small woodland pond--the highest point on the trail. From the pond, a series of twisting turns leads into some mountain biking features, before reaching a horse trail crossing.

Past the ridge line horse crossing, the trail begins to descend toward Potato Run, with another series of features popular with mountain bikers, as it drops down into the valley. 

Use caution while approaching the horse trails, and yield to horseback riders, if present.

With a twisting climb up the other side of the creek, the trail begins to level out, with another series of bike features, before joining the Potato Run Trail.

A left at the trail junction will return the user up Potato Run toward the campground while a right turn will allow the user to continue toward the bottom of the Group Camp Trail.

Hike through a forest dominated by maple, beech, basswood, and oak trees. Follow a stretch of the Little Calumet River, once a critical transportation route for early regional travelers, and explore the recently restored Mnok Prairie for a glimmer of the vast stretches of pre-settlement grasslands. 

Visit the Bailly Homestead and Chellberg Farm to glimpse how families lived and farmed in Northwest Indiana. 

The Bailly Homestead, a National Historic Landmark (1962), was the home of Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774 - 1835). Bailly played a role in the development of the Calumet Region of northern Indiana. He was an independent trader in the extensive fur-trading network that spread from Montreal to Louisiana, and ultimately to Europe. Joseph Bailly was one of the earliest settlers in northern Indiana. In 1822, Bailly set up his fur trading post at the crossroads of several important trails. The Bailly Homestead complex is the last remaining site of its nature in the Calumet Region.

In the 1870s, Swedish immigrants Anders and Johanna ""Kjellberg"" bought 80 acres to establish a modest family farm. They were the first of three generations of the Chellberg Family to make their living here. In the 1930s, the Chellbergs started to tap the many maple trees on their property for the production of maple syrup.

The Annual Maple Sugar Time event in March (first 2 weekends) features the evolution of ""maple sugaring"" in Northwest Indiana from an early American Indian method, to the pioneer method of boiling sap in open iron kettles, to the relatively modern commercial method of producing syrup. Indiana Dunes National Park is the only National Park Service location that makes maple syrup.

There are 3 covered picnic shelters near the parking lot that are wheelchair accessible. The shelters are reservable at recreation.gov starting six months in advance of the desired use date. Cooking fires at the picnic shelters are permitted in the provided grills or an approved carry-in grill. An approved grill is a noncombustible container with an enclosed bottom and enclosed sides with a minimum depth of 2 inches. Charcoal must be cooled and safely disposed of in a noncombustible container or removed from the area.

The trail initially follows a very rutted and often muddy horse trail that can be uneven even in the wintertime when the previous season's muddy furrows have frozen over. Fortunately, several of the most heavily disturbed sections of trail have been bypassed singletrack that is designated with ""hiking"" signs.

Because the trails follows along a gentle ridge, it isn't very strenuous, especially compared to the nearby Pate Hollows trails. Eventually, the trail turns into all singletrack with an awesome hillside overlook of the lake before it descends more steeply toward the edge of the peninsula.

Along the final leg, the trail is shored up by timbers to help combat the swampiness. The last descent brings hikers to the rocky shoreline of Lake Monroe where some nearby lakeside houses are visible. This is a great spot to enjoy lunch or a swim before heading back to the trailhead.

With a couple of steep uphill climbs and descents along washed out terrain, this 2.2-mile trail is scenic and secluded, while also offering a bit of a challenge. One of the more difficult trails in the state park, this trail will definitely get you winded in some spots, but isn’t so tough that you have to be an expert to complete it. 

It starts at the firetower, which also is something fun to do in the park (if you can make the climb up the stairs, the view from the 90-foot structure is worth it). 

After hitting the trail, you'll hike along a wide, straight path before meeting a split in the trail. Stay to the left to continue your hike. Next, you’ll approach a steep descent, which levels out at the bottom. A couple more small ascents and descents, and you’ll discover a little pond about one mile in. Shortly after, the trail will become more washed out as you encounter a steep descent into the trail basin. 

At your lowest point, around 1.3 miles in, you’ll cross a creek bed before beginning your ascent out. Get ready for a pretty tough uphill climb for a couple tenths of a mile before the trail flattens out. Then, it’s time to climb again until you reach the Shelter House at mile 1.9. Catch your breath and take a break before wrapping up the trail with one more moderate climb that will take you back to the initial split. Once there, it’s smooth sailing until you reach the end.

The fall colors will make up for the lack of the overlooks if you happen to be visiting in September-October. The right timing here will give you awesome colors to enjoy.

This trail is open for mountain biking and horse riding, so it's a good idea to keep your eyes and ears open for other trail users. The south parking area is rather small but the north parking will handle plenty of cars and those with horse trailers.

The trail then rolls along the ridge to the ""peak"". You'll find some dinner table sized rocks, just past the peak on the left (south) side of the trail. These are the Hominy Mortars, rumored to be a place where natives ground corn, but likely just some neat holes in the rocks. Turn around and follow the trail back for a 3.5+/- mile total.

One of the highlights of the trail is that it is the access trail to the Fire Tower Trail. The fire tower is one of the highest point in the surrounding counties, allowing you to see for miles in every direction and providing some excellent views. Taking this trail will add some distance and increase the difficulty due to much steeper grades and several flights of stairs up the tower, but it is quite worth it.

Along the way, its well-maintained tread allows you to worry less about tripping over obstacles and focus your attention on soaking up your surroundings. 

To start this trail, park at Ogle Lake and follow the Ogle Lake Trail #7 along its southern rim. In just a few short steps, take a right at the fork and follow the trail as it leaves the lake to climb steeply up a ridgeline. Enjoy feelings of accomplishment atop the ridge before descending sharply down the backside to a drainage below. You'll re-create this sequence over the next ridgeline and adjacent drainage before climbing out of the drainage and ending the trail at the junction with the Taylor Ridge Trail #9. From here, you can either return the way you came or enjoy a loop around the Taylor Ridge Trail #9 for more gorgeous woodland views and true serenity.

It's far enough off the trail that passersby will likely not notice you there. This ""secrecy"" is somewhat reinforced because the spur is not marked on current maps, though there is some signage.

The casual trail has lots of twists and turns but minimal obstacles as it travels through old growth forests on the north and west sides of Bendix Woods County Park. Along the way, it intersects with the Raccoon Run Trail and crosses over active roads at several points, so be on the lookout for other trail users and cars.

The local bike club NIMBA does a great job keeping the trail edges trimmed and cleared of fallen limbs or trees and the trail typically dries out faster than other local trails after a rain. 

The park has an entrance fee / annual pass that you can buy, although 90% of the time the park is open with no fees required. The fee is only charged on days when an attendant is manning the park entrance. If there is an event going on, then it is likely someone will be manning the entrance and collecting the entrance fee.

The loop starts here and can be taken in either direction.  

If you like to climb stairs, go left; if you prefer to climb on trail, go right. Going right, the trail wanders along a ridge and then heads down to the creek on a series of wooden stairs. This next part can get a little tricky, depending on water levels in the creek. You'll see the remnants of stairs across the creek. You need to get across to continue.  

Follow the path as it crosses the creek a couple more times. You'll find a sign pointing to the Tall Timbers Trail Spur, this takes you down to the banks of the Big Walnut. Once you've had your fill of this, return on the spur to the junction, and go right, over the boardwalks and up the hill.  

As you come out of the steepest part of the climb, keep an eye out for a small carved rock on the creek side of the trail.  Follow the trail out, and you'll be back to the loop junction shortly. While you're in the area, there is a fantastic covered bridge just down the hill from the parking lot.

Around 0.70 miles in, the trail begins uphill, and stays mostly uphill until the trail meets up again with the short loop. Follow the gravel road to the right to return to the parking lot.

A common route people use for this trail is to start on the short loop, turning right soon after leaving the parking lot. Upon arriving at the pond, taking another right onto this trail, and finishing out on the gravel road.

The preserve is part of the Valparaiso Moraine, which was formed by the last ice age. The nature preserve contains a combination of rolling ridges, steep hills, and ponds. The trail is surrounded by a beech-maple forest. There are excellent wildflowers in the spring and migrational birding in the spring and fall.

This trail is popular with overnight campers at marked and unmarked campsites. The beginning and ending legs of the trail receive the heaviest traffic because of the campsites and the graveyard, but your company quickly thins toward the middle of the trail.

Explore the recently restored Mnoke Prairie for a glimmer of the vast stretches of pre-settlement grasslands. 

Visit the Bailly Homestead and Chellberg Farm to glimpse how families lived and farmed in Northwest Indiana. 

The Bailly Homestead, a National Historic Landmark (1962), was the home of Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774 - 1835). Bailly played a role in the development of the Calumet Region of northern Indiana. He was an independent trader in the extensive fur-trading network that spread from Montreal to Louisiana, and ultimately to Europe. Joseph Bailly was one of the earliest settlers in northern Indiana. In 1822, Bailly set up his fur trading post at the crossroads of several important trails. The Bailly Homestead complex is the last remaining site of its nature in the Calumet Region.

In the 1870s, Swedish immigrants Anders and Johanna ""Kjellberg"" bought 80 acres to establish a modest family farm. They were the first of three generations of the Chellberg Family to make their living here. In the 1930s, the Chellbergs started to tap the many maple trees on their property for the production of maple syrup.

The Annual Maple Sugar Time event in March (first 2 weekends) features the evolution of ""maple sugaring"" in Northwest Indiana from an early American Indian method, to the pioneer method of boiling sap in open iron kettles, to the modern commercial method of producing syrup. Indiana Dunes National Park is the only National Park Service location that makes maple syrup.

It's really nice having these two optional routes at the beginning and end of your hike so that you can adjust your distance easily. If you take Pine Loop to North Gate Trail then continue up to the top of the hill at North Tower Loop, it's about 1.7 miles vs. 1.1 miles if you take the North Gate Trail directly.

From its end, take a right to follow a stretch of trail from earlier back to the trailhead and the Taylor Ridge Campground.

The trail has some water erosion, but is wide enough to hike alongside. A few creek crossings down in the valley can be challenging after a heavy rain. The trail occasionally meanders part ways up the side of the hill and affords some nice elevated views of the creek below. Eventually the trail rises up and weaves through an old pine grove before meeting with the Foxy Hollow Trail about 1 mile from the trailhead. Continuing south on the fire tower trail, you'll cross another gravel road, and then arrive at another fork in the trail in about 1.3 miles. The fork to the right (southwest) will lead you to the campground. The fork to the left (southeast) continues down into another valley where the trail meets the Twin Lakes Trail. Just before meeting the Twin Lakes Trail is a wide, shallow creek crossing that may lead to wet feet if unable to find enough stepping stones.

1.3,Point to Point,885,828,85,139,3,26,Lakeshore Trail,Intermediate,3.5,"        This is one of the longest trails in Whitewater Memorial State Park and begins at the parking area near the Hornbeam Nature Preserve. From the parking lot, follow the signs into the trees. The first part of the trail includes a half mile loop via the Lakeshore Trail Alternate. You can choose to go left or right since both directions will eventually take you to the longer portion of the trail that follows the edge of the lake. 

Throughout this trail, you'll be hiking through Indiana woodlands with some hills and valleys that will take you near the water's edge for most of the trail. Shortly after the loop, there is a very short segment that will take you down to the water's edge. This is a great spot for a picture or just to watch the activity on the lake. As you continue from here, you'll be able to see various waterfowl. Plus, be on the lookout for small turtles and frogs sunning near the shore.

As you approach the end of the trail, you'll come to a wooden staircase that takes you down to the observation deck at the end of the trail. Depending on the time of year, you'll be able to see some views of the lake, but be advised the observation deck is at lake level but not actually on the lake. It is surrounded by trees, so your view may be blocked during the warmer seasons. While here, take some time to catch your breath and keep an eye and ear out for the various species of birds found in this area. From here, it's time to turn around and head back to the parking area. I personally like trails like this as you get to see the whole trail from both perspectives, coming and going.

The first part of this trail goes through the woods and is more difficult than the other 3/4 of the trip. There are pretty views and it's only a moderate trail, not too strenuous, to the first waterfall (approx. 1/4 mile in). There are twp potential creek crossings depending on water level. The creek isn't too wide and we were able to cross in winter without getting wet (the second crossing had more water than the first). 

After about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile you'll be out of the woods and on to the wide and mostly flat grass path through a fairly young pine grove. There is a short boardwalk through a small wetlands area around mile 1. To shorten the outing, you could cut across one of the connector paths to make a shorter loop. The paths and trail are well maintained (at least they were clear in the winter) and easy to follow. I highly recommend not missing the first part of the trail if you are at all interested in the views!

1.2,Point to Point,683,453,102,235,5,18,Green Blaze Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.0,"        The Green Blaze Trail is a camp favorite that, while small in length, is big in trailside spectacles. Mainly, this trail leads to the camp's underground waterfall (a sub-surface expression of water that is viewable through a ""skylight"" in the ground above).

Starting at the Parking Area, the trail heads east through picturesque Indiana hardwoods on a leafy tread until reaching a junction with the White Blaze Trail. Make a right at the junction to continue on the Green Blaze Trail, climbing gently out of the woodlands for a brief moment to skirt the edge of a field. After diving back into the woodlands at the end of the field, the trail traverses the same woods from before, now heading downhill, for a short distance before popping out onto a doubletrack road. As quickly as the trail joins the road, it both dives back into the woods and increases in steepness drastically. Upon reaching the road for a second time, the trail offers great views of the lake and a great spot to enjoy some water or a snack.

When you're ready to continue, the trail makes a sharp left turn to climb gently along the banks of Big Run. With roughly half a mile of creekside trail (which is actually only running after heavy rains or flooding), you'll have plenty of time to enjoy its pleasant company. After rejoining the White Blaze Trail briefly, the end of the trail is met with its most interesting feature: the underground waterfall.

Cascading under the surface, this waterfall is only visible through a small opening in the ground that's partially covered by rocks and detritus. Further adding to its novelty is the lack of visible water anywhere else around it, and the large hills to its sides. For those that know a thing or two about groundwater, this can be an interesting spot to give a lesson to those uninitiated.

Once you've enjoyed the waterfall to your heart's content, you can either return the way you came, or you can jump onto the White Blaze Trail to extend your pleasant experience in these Indiana woodlands.

The Hobart Prairie Grove preserves several habitats including wetlands, prairie remnants, white oak flatlands, and a rare bur oak savanna. At about 300 acres in size, it contains 343 native plants and an abundance of wildlife. This area is also noteworthy because of a unique soil that is made up of at least 70 percent silt and clay with the smaller portions of sand. This type of soil is one of the reasons for the outstanding diversity of life here at Hobart Prairie Grove.

1.6,Loop,693,667,54,54,1,6,Outer Loop,Intermediate,3.0,"        1.7-mile singletrack close to Purdue University nestled between the golf course and Cherry lane. There's a small parking area at the trailhead and/or about 200 yards away from a paved trail that runs from Purdue to West Lafayette.

The trail is generally clear as it's built for biking.  So there are few roots and rocks.  A few small hills provide a bit of work and the continuous winding keep your attention.  The south side of the trail can be muddy after rain.

You'll soon cross a small, now broken footbridge built by Boy Scout Troop 40 of Liberty, IN. The trail remains mostly flat and heavily shaded for the next mile. You'll soon come across a peaceful pond on the left side of the trail.

Around a mile in, you'll pass cropland and a few small, grassy meadows. You may notice the strange evenly spread out mix of pine and deciduous trees along this trail, especially compared to the other trails around Brookville Lake. About 1.5 miles in, the trail will descend down towards the lake. You'll be able to catch glimpses of the lake in late fall, winter, and early spring.

The rest of the trail follows the side of Garr Hill running parallel to the lake and a small river. Eventually the trail descends and crosses the small river with an obnoxiously large concrete bridge. The remainder of the trail is flat and follows the river to the Garr Hill Boat Ramp and parking.

A short spur trail takes you down to the two twin caves, and boat tours inside the cave are available for $3 a person. The tours are short, family friendly, and worth the $3 fee. Check the Spring Mill website for a tour schedule.

Turn right at the top of the stairs to Twin Caves and head towards Bronson Cave. After about 0.1 miles, the trail comes to an overlook of Bronson Cave, which is off-limits to exploring. Parts of the cave have been known to trap spelunkers and water can rise without warning.

Continuing past Bronson Cave, the trail traverses through old timber forest and countless sinkholes, common for this area. The trail crosses two roads before meeting the Connector: Trail 4 to Trail 3 and later Connector: Spring Mill Inn to Trail 3. There is an overlook of Donaldson Cave in winter but not in summer. To get a better view of Donaldson Cave, take the connector to Trail 4 and hike down to see the cave.

Passing the connector to the Inn, the trail crosses two more roads before going through more dense forest and returning to the parking area for Twin Caves.

0.5,Lollipop,903,816,100,99,8,20,Lookout Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        Lookout Trail starts from the playground across from the Studebaker pine trees. It is easy to find. The trail surface is packed dirt with leaf litter. The first part of the trail is easy to follow as it travels along the side of Carlisle Hill. At the south end the trail comes upon the maple syrup operation with a sugar shack. In the late winter, there is an amazing web of plastic tubes that run from each tree to larger lines and eventually to the sugar shack. The trail will turn to the right and head up the hill. The path was difficult to follow until the well-worn rut was found that has clearly been used for decades.

Take the trail to the top of the hill. Try to imagine that this was once an operational downhill ski area from 1969 until 1986. There are remnants of the rope tows and and an alpine slide that never opened due to safety concerns. Finish the trail by heading north down the front of the hill back to the playground.

It is recommended when taking this trail to add Lower Big Tree Trail to the outing.

Bendix Woods County Park was once owned by the famed Studebaker Automobile Corporation. 840 acres were purchased in 1926 and became the first automobile proving grounds in America. Various road conditions were simulated to test their cars. Although it was a testing facility, Studebaker maintained the grounds as a natural area. In 1938, they planted 8,000 pine trees that spell the their name ""STUDEBAKER"" when viewed from the air. You can still see it today on the map above running north-south. The trees were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The proving grounds were sold to the Bendix corporation in 1963, which in turn donated 195 acres to St. Joseph County to establish the county park. The rest of the acreage is still being used as automotive proving grounds today. Bendix used the grounds until 1996, selling it to Bosch who then sold the land to Navistar in 2015.

Bendix Woods County Park was once owned by the famed Studebaker Automobile Corporation. 840 acres were purchased in 1926 and became the first automobile proving grounds in America. Various road conditions were simulated to test their cars. Although it was a testing facility, Studebaker maintained the grounds as a natural area. In 1938, they planted 8,000 pine trees that spell the their name ""STUDEBAKER"" when viewed from the air. You can still see it today on the map above running north-south. The trees were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. 

The proving grounds were sold to the Bendix corporation in 1963, which in turn donated 195 acres to St. Joseph County to establish the county park. The rest of the acreage is still being used as automotive proving grounds today. Bendix used the grounds until 1996, selling it to Bosch who then sold the land to Navistar in 2015.
