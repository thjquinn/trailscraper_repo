The Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail is a major segment of the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail, a network of trails between the mouth of the Potomac River and the Allegheny Highlands. Click here for more info.

The Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail is open year-round and is blazed approximately every 100 feet with 2-inch and 5-inch yellow blazes. Connector trails lead to and from trailheads and shelter areas and are marked with blue blazes. Mileage monuments are every mile. Yellow bands around trees mark the trail at every major road crossing.

A hiker's guide to the Laurel Highlands Trail is available from the Sierra Club Allegheny Group. The guide describes the trail and aids in planning outings. Included in the guide are detailed topographic maps plus information on geology, climate, plants and wildlife.

Trailheads 
Six trailheads provide 30-car parking lots, overnight parking and trash receptacles.

Voluntary day use registration mailboxes are located in each of the trailheads for day hikers to fill out information cards for vital park attendance data and for use in an emergency. For overnight use of the trail see the LHHT Regulations section.

5.9,Point to Point,212,103,419,413,3,15,Orange Trail,Intermediate,4.7,"        The trail starts on Germantown Avenue where the road crosses Wissahickon Creek. It ends down at Historic Rittenhouse Town. 

In between is a pretty technical set of trails that take you through some really pretty territory. 

The trail winds down the Wissahickon Creek and passes by covered bridges, dams, light rapids and crosses streams. 

Check out the covered bridge in the first third of the trail and the Fingerspan bridge sculpture in the last third. This sculpture had to be helicoptered into place!

The trail is not marked very clearly, so make sure you pay attention at intersections etc. When in doubt stay closer to the creek and use the Hiking Project mobile app to make sure you stay on track.

27.6,Point to Point,1564,1073,3692,3692,5,32,Gerard Hiking Trail,Intermediate,4.6,"        There are several parking areas at the Park Office at Petroleum Center. The trail starts directly behind the park office, and goes up a steep hill, following white blazes. In about a half a mile, there will be a sign that directs trail goers towards Miller Farm, following the yellow blazes. Visitors will follow the yellow blazed Girard trail for approximately 15 miles on the eastern side of Oil Creek, descending into the Oil Creek Valley, then ascending back up to the ridges several times.  The trail is mainly dirt singletrack, with numerous roots and rocks, a few muddy areas, but nothing terribly technical or difficult.

Once the visitor descends after 15 miles, they will cross a single-lane car-bridge (Jersey Bridge), go through a parking lot and up a paved bike trail for about two tenths of a mile.  They will then make a right onto the Gerard trail again, marked by a sign hanging over the singletrack trail.  Again, trail users will ascend and descend through the Oil Creek valley, staying on the Yellow blazed trail on the west side of Oil Creek.  There are several white blazed side trails, which cross the valley.  Be cautious of several road crossings - though not busy, drivers can be traveling quickly.  Once you come down to an Oil Derrick tableau, you'll come down a hill to a wooden arch bridge that brings visitors to a paved road. Cross over this road to the trail, and continue on for about a mile.  You'll come to another dirt road, and you'll turn left on this road to get back to the Petroleum Center parking area.

This long trail can be accessed from several points. The easiest access points are the Jersey Bridge parking area near Drake's Well Park or from the Oil Creek State Park park office at Petroleum Center which is how the trail is shown mapped here. There are permanent pit toilets located at the Petroleum Center parking areas, as well as water at the park office. During spring, summer and fall, there are port-a-johns located at the Jersey Bridge Parking area.  Maps are available at the Park office or at the parking area at Jersey Bridge.

3.8,Point to Point,2903,2522,543,520,5,28,McCune Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.7,"        This trail passes through various habitats and by evidence of the McCune Farm. Around mile 1, Hikers can see a stone foundation and an old springhouse and pond that serve as remnants of this working farm. The trail runs along the highest ridge in the park. 

The first half of the trail is very easy hiking along a wide, well-maintained trail. At the halfway point, there is a bench with a nice view overlooking the Youghiogheny River Valley. The second half of the trail is narrower with some inclines and is heavily forested with no more vistas, so feel free to turn back at the bench overlook if you're not looking for something wilder. 

The second half of the trail does include some old boulders, including one around 30 feet high that you can climb to the top. 

This is a lightly used and secluded trail, and it is a loop that brings you back to the small parking lot (which may fit 3-4 vehicles) at the trailhead.

0.5,Point to Point,1362,595,767,0,29,53,Thousand Steps Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Parking, as well as the trailhead, are on the side of US 22. Care must be taken, due to the fact that the trailhead is to the east of the parking area, and hiking near the road for a short distance is required. 

At the trailhead, signs describe the rules, trail, and history of the trail. According to the display, the steps were built in the 1930's for miners as they made their way to the Ledge Quarry, a sandstone mine. 

The steps start almost immediately and lead up the mountain. The trail is a tough 0.5 miles, but pull-offs are present for the occasional break. The steps are numbered every 100 so progress can be measured; each 100 is a worthy accomplishment! The usual fauna and flora of the area surround the trail, and it is a very enjoyable experience (one may not think so on the way up, but look around on the return trip!). 

Once the top step is achieved (step 1037 to be exact), a well-deserved rest is in order. If the quaking legs allow, a right (south) at the top of the steps is the Mount Union View Trail, and a left is the Standing Stone Trail-State Game Land 112 Segment. Return to the parking area on the same trail. Be careful on the way down; the steps are often slippery in the winter as they may be snow and ice covered.

1.5,Point to Point,1726,1246,1,480,6,20,Lingle Valley Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Lingle Valley Trail is like taking a journey to the Land of the Lost. Surely pterodactyls have hunkered down to weather the millennia in this jumbly thicket of singletrack goodness.

This challenging downhill run crosses the stream no less than five times and winds its way through thick rhododendron bushes. One of the most unusual, beautiful, and thoroughly enjoyable trails in Cooper's Gapwith some serious steeps (in a couple early sections). So, do be a tad careful. 

Accessing this superb trail is done off of Chestnut Spring Trail, marked by a wooden post. You'll immediately start dropping like a stone, then you'll cross an old school bridge over the beginnings of Little Kettle Creek. Once you pass this, you'll soon find yourself among more moderate grades. There are a couple BIG logs, with stone and wooden ramps over them (for the bikers; you can probably just step over them..). The stream crossings are all wadeable (if the water is not at peak heights) and the trail twists like a dervish through crazy rhododendron land. 

At the end of the trail, you'll come out at a hunting camp.

1.0,Point to Point,1145,793,0,352,7,15,Iron Gate,Difficult,4.7,"        Iron Gate is an awesome trail, offering a challenge to Pittsburgh'ers whom don't have much trail climbs within the city limits.  

Starting from the end of Fire Lane, enter the trail staying left at the first two forks.  You'll know you are on the correct path when you come to a 10' long wooden bridge.  Be careful at this bridge.  It tends to dip 1-2' in the middle, giving a little springboard launch as you cross over.

From this point on there are no major intersecting trails other than Concrete Block, which is easy enough to miss.  At the end of the trail you'll be standing above a baseball field, and what might be the highest point in Frick Park.  

With 350' of climb in under a mile, this trail tests conditioning.  For extra ""fun"" hit it up in winter when snow and ice have formed.

3.6,Point to Point,1994,1660,86,370,2,10,Little Mountain Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Little Mountain Trail would be over run with people if it was just near somewhere else, or it was easier to link into other hikes. As it is though, it's worth the effort it takes to get to it. 

After a short uphill, the trail is mostly all down over pretty easy grades. The trail can be quite rugged and rocky. There is a section referred to as ""the Slot"" where the trail goes through a 30 inch gap in two shoulder high boulders. 

The only intersection is a bit tricky, as Little Mountain actually veers right slightly but continues on the ridge. Al; maps show this intersection as being a right angle 4 way intersection, but that's not how it looks in real life, so be careful.

This trail has a good amount of elevation change throughout. Begin the hike in the direction mapped by taking Berry Patch or Ridge to their NW terminus. All of these trails converge at a scenic area that overlooks the lake. Take in the view, and start Rays there. 

The first two miles of this trail are definitely the most fun, since most of it is DOWN. From the overlook, youll lose about 300 feet in this section.

The decision making arrives at the end of the downhill. If you are heading back to the Bakers Hollow Lot, take Sidewinder down hike up Osprey to take the quickest way back via Fawn or Doe. Going up on Sidewinder will be a bit longer by taking Loco Motive, Red Legs, Grippis and Allie. Or, for even a longer hike, you could use Osprey to access Hydro Loop, Eagle and Sleek Dog before working your way back.

2.4,Point to Point,339,196,147,122,2,7,Yellow Loop,Intermediate,5.0,"        The Yellow Loop is an easy hike through Stroud Preserve taking the hiker past wetlands and through woodlands and farmland. It begins at the same location as the Green Loop and the Red Loop near the small parking lot along Creek Road. 

The trail skirts farm fields and forests, occasional dipping into the trees. The trail is open to horseback riding and has a few mucky spots where the horses have pounded the dirt into mud (depending on season and recent weather).

Excellent for hikers, dog-walkers, and families interested in a day out. Well-marked and maintained. Excellent place to view foliage in the fall.

3.8,Point to Point,1298,1018,250,345,3,7,Allegheny Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Allegheny Trail is at the far southern end of the Raystown trail network. It has a real backcountry feel with climbs, descents throughout thick forest.  You'll feel like you're in a jungle at times as the lush vegetation closes in around you.

From the intersection with Dirt Surfer and Shade, Allegheny has a steep-ish but short climb before an enjoyable descent to a road crossing. From there the downhill continues as it contours around steep hillsides. If you take a moment to check out the hillside below, you might notice how high up you are.  At some points you'll feel like you're hiking through the tree canopy. 

There's one more rugged climb and short descent before reaching the far end of Allegheny where it meets a junction with Dirt Surfer and Barrel Bay.  Stay left for a shorter connection back to Shade or stay right for a longer hike on Barrel Bay.

1.6,Point to Point,1505,1225,324,46,4,12,Deer Tick Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        A multiple switchback ascent out of Cooper's Gap, this climb is definitely not the easy way to the top. There are lots of roots and rocks, with a few steep pitches thrown in. However, it's pretty much the only way up at that end of the valley. 

The first stretch from Cooper's Gap up to the unnamed haul road used to be called ""Long Cut"", basically because it takes a long time to go a short distance. Once you cross the haul road, you've got a short steep climb before you get to Deer Tick proper. Be on the look out for a sharp right, as it's easy to miss. If you do miss it, the trail loops around and doubles back in about 75 feet. It's probably the only trail with a cul de sac. 

The climb up is very cool, as it crosses through multiple forest stages and opens up into a nice hard wood forest. There are some great rock formations and if you look over your shoulder, you can catch glimpses of Big Valley off in the distance.

It works great in either direction, but the aastern end has some of the most difficult rock features and tightest tree gaps of any place in the forest. 

The trail connects several feed plots along Coopers Gap, so it's not uncommon to hear the buzz of swarms of honey bees working the apple trees in these clearings. Supposedly Rich Wertz, the trail builder, followed a bear's meanderings through the woods to come up with the layout.

Running just off the foot of the wall, the trail consists of one foot diameter, and smaller, rocks that have broken free of the wall. Rock climbers frequent the area giving hikers the chance to watch as they scramble up the wall. Be careful when taking your eyes off the trail because the terrain constantly changes. Always within view of the GAP, hikers can easily jump off the trail and back on if necessary. This section lasts for roughly a mile and half before taking a 90-degree turn into the wall face.

As you approach the wall, there is a small waterfall to your right.  At the wall face the trail takes a hard left turn, runs at the foot of the wall before a steep climb and switch back, followed by a steep climb of a few hundred feet (denoted on the map by the straight section running east and west immediately after the switch back.

The rest of the trail is rocky with a climb or two. The trail ends at the Beech Loop Trail, which provides access to the Kentuck Campground as well as the Sproul XC Ski Trail system.

5.8,Point to Point,1253,911,672,482,4,19,Slippery Rock Gorge Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.2,"        The seemingly never-ending rock ledges and rutted trail make this trail difficult to find a groove and get up to pace. There are several climbs of 200-300 feet at maybe 5-10% grades, but those are almost enjoyable in comparison to hiking downhill.  

The trail starts just up the road from the ""Point"" parking lot and, as part of the North Country Trail system, is blazed in a bright blue. From the start you are hiking among large boulders and must navigate your way down to Slippery Rock Creek.

You'll continue on until you reach the covered bridge. Cross the bridge, and the trail is on the left just 100 feet after exiting the bridge.

You'll stay on this trail for about a half mile to mile before reaching Eckert Bridge. Here you can connect with Kildoo Trail (the other side of Eckert Bridge) and head back to the covered bridge for a shorter loop (4 miles).  

The next part is the longest section and also takes you up the slope in 200 or 300 foot chunks.  You'll have some views of the creek, but this will be the mostly manageable, as up the slope is just about a rock-free section of the trail.  

You'll come to a sign with three planks calling out the Slippery Rock Trail, Hell's Hollow, and Walnut Flats. Continue towards Hell's Hollow (it's a right) along the Slippery Rock Trail. This is the best section of the entire trail, offering small pine cover, gorgeous sections along Hell's Hollow with views, and more gentle terrain.  

The trail ends at the Hell's Hollow parking lot.

58.5,Point to Point,2108,759,9947,9115,6,50,Loyalsock Trail,Difficult,4.4,"        With an elevation profile that resembles an irregular rhythm EKG, scenic vistas at the top of punishing climbs, and hemlock shaded mountain streams to run beside, the Loyalsock Trail does not disappoint.

The scenic and challenging Loyalsock Trail runs roughly parallel to its namesake creek. The name Loyalsock Creek is taken from the Indian phrase ""Lawi-Saquick,"" meaning middle creek, and flows between Muncy Creek and Lycoming Creek.

The trail takes advantage of long-abandoned timber roads and railroad grades, reminders of the logging industry.

What follows should be considered a rough sketch of a few featured sections:

PA Route 87 to Little Bear Road  Not even 5 miles, but it feels like much more:
This section begins with one of the notorious climbs to the Allegheny Ridge. Once on top, enjoy the smooth singletrack. Then, as you hike along the Allegheny Front, look to your right for views of the rolling farmland to the south. You'll know when you reach the infamous, steep, wet, mossy, slippery, path down Petes Hollow. Insider tip: Dont miss the stinging nettle patch that adorns this descent in the summer.

Little Bear Road to Dunwoody Road  A little over 10 miles:
Why not begin another section with a notorious climb? Toward the top, views of Loyalsock Creek make it all worthwhile. Traverse Smiths Knob, cross hemlock-lined Painter Run and savor the trail as you ascend Red Ridge. Youll appreciate some outstanding trail as you explore the headwaters of Shingle Run, Grandad Run, and Hessler Branch before reaching Dunwoody Road. Insider tip: The laurel blooms mid to late June.

Worlds End State Park to Route 220  13ish miles
The section has a bolder field called the rock stairs, visits High Rock Vista, has some smooth singletrack twisting through hemlock forest, and follows the historic Williamsport and North Branch Railroad grade.  Youll pass Alpine Falls, Sones Pond, and the Haystacks on your way to the eastern end of the LT.  Insider tip: you pass some of the best swimming holes on Loyalsock Creek

This is still the mountainous trail characteristic of the area. It is a fun-filled, varied challenge that mostly steadily descends the whole way.

Find the Miller trailhead at the North parking area, which also has Hess Trail and Whitetail Trail-Pine Knob Trail access points. The descent starts with a short rise, followed by turns, a few narrower sections, a little ruggedness, all leading up to a sketchier section over rocks and between trees. While exciting, there is nothing here that should deter confident hikers. At its terminus the Miller Trail meets Mill Run Trail which is stunning for its beauty as it courses along the valley floor next to the stream.

6.0,Point to Point,1237,1000,568,600,4,12,Red/Blue Blaze,Intermediate,4.2,"        The Red/Blue Blaze Trail is heavily used. It's an in-and-out path extends for 2 miles ""as a crow flies"" and is 6 miles of continuous, uninterrupted trail. This is a must-do hike for people in the Pittsburgh area, as it is only a few miles from the city but offers seclusion.

The Red/Blue Blaze Trail runs from North Ridge Road near the Ice Skating Rink to Irwin Run where Babcock Blvd intersects Pierce Mill Rd. The trail was originally constructed in the mid 1990's By Dave Brunger and Bill Kirk as the Rainbow Trail. This runs from the Skating Rink side to the Wisconsin Shelter. 

To find the trailhead from the Ice Skating rink side, start at the Olympia Shelter parking lot (across Pierce Mill Rd from the Skating Rink). Ride up North Ridge Rd for ~50 yards. The trail will start to your right. The trail winds up the initial ~.25 mile climb. The trail is continually marked with red/blue blazes, but does not cross any other trails. There are multiple opt-out locations in case you get tired or run short on time. All opt-outs put you on North Ridge Drive, which you can take northward and end up back at the double lot.

1.8,Point to Point,350,224,188,202,4,23,Orange Trail,Intermediate,4.3,"        This is a beautiful, mostly easy hike when you have an hour to kill. Ridley Creek State Park is quite popular and can get a lot of foot traffic. I like this trail when I want to avoid the crowd. 

The parking lot is on the south side of Gradyville Rd and only a max of 5 or 6 cars can fit. The trail is well marked and easy to follow. It is a looped trail. About 600 feet in, it will fork and start its loop. Hiking left will take you up an incline deeper into the woods. Hiking right will take you along Ridley Creek.

My preferred path is to take the left fork and get a workout going up and back down the hill then finish it off with a peaceful hike along the creek.

After the left fork, the northeastern part of the trail is the most difficult and has several sections dense with roots so please watch your footing. In this section, the hike up the hill and back down will exceed 10% at some parts and may require getting a hand hold on some trees to assist with the ascent/descent.

The part of the trail along Ridley Creek is the easiest and offers many points with access to the creek for our four legged friends to cool off. Also, along this section of the trail you'll have to cross two water run-off points. They aren't a big deal on dry days, but take caution during raining hikes or if there was a good soaking rain the previous day.

It's marked by standard double-blazes but it could be missed. Hess is a great hike in either direction.

The Hess Trail starts at the trailhead parking area and is usually done to start the Clockwise Quebec Loop. You'll descend the steep section of the Hess Trail, which can be a wake up call because it is moderately steep and rough due to an abundance of small rocks. The junction with the Tebolt Trail is reached very quickly. From here the Hess Trail is mostly rough doubletrack and you'll find intersections with Whitetail Trail-Pine Knob Trail and Miller Trail further up the trail.

Most will turn left to continue on the Hess Trail as part of the Clockwise Quebec loop. This section is mountainous singletrack with a couple of small creek crossings and a few short, steep uphill sections. There are also several short stretches of fun downhill.

The preferred direction to hike it is from west to east, which becomes readily apparent once you look at the elevation profile.

Cowbell Hollow Trail starts out as an access road to a large food plot planted by the Wild Turkey Federation. Stay to the left of the field to enter the trail proper. The trail quickly drops into a drainage where another trail bisects it. Stay straight here, and climb to the other side. At this point, the trail has ""naturalized"" into a ribbon of singletrack meanders through a slightly larger clearing. 

Shortly after this meander, the trail crests the rise and begins to gradually turn downhill. When you notice the forest change from newer trees and shrubs and begins to be dominated by larger trees, be prepared for the bottom to drop out of the trail. From this point on, the trail maintains a 10-15% downhill grade, with a few washed out sections. This continues for well over a mile. The end has a few wooden bridges that can be slick, so be careful. Eventually, the trail dumps you out at a cabin and just short of the road.

If you want to use it as a downhill, start out on the Lower Seven Mile Connector and look for the entrance to the trail on the left side off the connector, a map or the Hiking Project mobile app will be handy.  Once you find it, hike to the top of the ridge then turn left next to a rock wall. This is where it gets crazy. It is a very steep downhill with lots of rocks and saplings to maneuver around. 

If you make it through this section, you'll encounter a steep drop that brings you down to the stream. Cross over and hike the trail on the other side until you see a big tree down. Cross back over that. Once you cross back, enjoy some very technical rock sections on your way out to the switchback of Raccoon Mountain Trail.

Or you may park at Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve located at the north terminus.  

Starting from the south terminus, the trail weaves through a small wooded area with the road to the left and Squaw Run to the right. In less than a half mile, the trail peeks out of the woods at a small cinder pull off before taking a hard right and crossing Squaw Run via large stepping stones. From here, hikers will make a short steep climb up the hillside and hike a section of trail at the foot of Shady Side Academy. There are numerous trails in this section crisscrossing the main trail. The best advice is to stay to the left. You're on the correct path if you are hiking just above the roadway. You may also want to looks at the Hiking Project mobile app if you want to be absolutely sure.

You'll exit the woods and hike through a parking lot leading to a dog park with a wooden gate. Dogs are off leash, and hikers should take caution when opening the gate to enter and exit. There are several paths you can take, all of which lead to the back of the park. Shortly after all the paths converge, you'll see a trail marker (concrete or wooden posts with a green circle and white arrow pointing the direction) directing you up a steep climb. While traveling south to north, the trail is always heading uphill; this is by far the biggest climb and toughest section. There is an equally long descent on the other end.  

When you exit the woods again, you'll see a small concrete block shed and another trail sign (this time brown with yellow print). You'll cross over Squaw Run once again, using large stepping stones. Then hikers will cross the roadway and begin the last section of trail, most of which is doubletrack.

This last section starts out slow, but less than mid-way through the climb begins to Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve. Fortunately, the ascent is at a low grade.

Hikers can extend their hike by entering Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve, which has glut of singletrack trails.

The first 13 miles of the trail are the easiest as they travel through Gallitzin State Forest along a mountain ridge bookended by rolling, mildly technical terrain. With several long, steady uphills, these miles act as a preamble to the second half, which is up and down many different peaks and crosses several wider streams. 

At mile 24 (along Hog Back Ridge) there is a monument built to two children who got lost in the mountains and perished in 1856.

There is only one trailhead located at the Hickory Creek parking area and the trail is marked with yellow or white blazes painted on trees. The markings are infrequent and often faded, so keep an eye out. Additionally, the trail is only maintained to primitive standards, which results in a lot of vegetation encroachment on the trail along with many fallen trees across the trail.

This trail offers challenges to a wide range of skill levels as it traverses the rolling terrain within the Hickory Creek Wilderness. Fishing for small native brookies can be done in East and Middle Hickory Creeks. These trails are open for winter hiking. Remember to dress in layers appropriate for the weather conditions and be aware that these trails are used heavily in the late fall and spring by hunters. It is a good idea to wear bright fluorescent colored clothing if hiking during these time periods.

The region certainly lives up to its name, as Pine Creek has carved steep slopes from the Pennsylvania landscape over millennia.  Today, the gorge is a beautiful and scenic locale. 

A long logging history once stripped this beautiful area of the ancient hardwood and pine forests that had thrived for centuries, though more recent protections from the National Parks Service and the Pennsylvania State Forest Service have made a great impact on the damage of the area. Today, 100-year-old trees and a variety of local fauna have returned to the gorge, providing for scenic company to any taking the rail trail. The recovery of the area is a testament to the resiliency of our natural world. 

The trail itself is well maintained, and is mostly composed of hard packed dirt or crushed limestone. While most visitors use one of two main trailheads, there are many access points on this trail, making it easy to plan an outing of almost any distance.

The trail makes several stream crossings and follows along two for short stretches, making the trail muddy at times.  There are definitely roots along the trail but, for the most part, the trail is a good ~9-mile point-to-point for all levels of hiker.

This will take you along route 18 crossing the stream and through a marshy area before a u-turn which heads up the hill side.

This section has pockets of pines which offer soft trail and a change of scenery.  Midway through you'll come to a fork in the trail, head left to stay on trail (this is marked with a sign).  Emerging from the woods, you'll cross over Heritage Trail and head down a cliff side via stairs, taking you to the waterfall.  This section is slippery, given it resides in the stream bed, but is unique in that sense.

3.2,Point to Point,1223,928,204,481,4,12,Red Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Access the trail from the Greer Road or at the Calumet shelter near the entrance to the park.  You make an initial very short climb from the parking lot and at the ""peak"" will see a sign signifying the highest point in the park at around 1,250 feet.  

The trail then heads downhill, crosses a road, and brings hikers to a ""Y"" in the trail.  Take the Lake Loop to the right.  The Lake Loop is identified by a simple wooden sign on a tree.  Staying right will take you to Greer Road.  In half a mile, you'll come out to the small lake/pond.  At the other end of the lake, you'll make a sharp left up the hill climbing 100 feet or so before leveling out and making your descent to Greer Road.  

The trail is smooth with a few sections with mud or roots.  The climbs and descents are steep and one section has loose rock, but in general it is a good trail for a hike.  

You'll have access to plenty of other unknown trails, but they don't all loop back, so you may want to study up at the park website or use the Hiking Project mobile app.

13.0,Point to Point,1527,1173,1648,1651,5,19,Glacier Ridge Trail,Difficult,3.8,"        The trailhead is located at the parking lot for the bike shop. As is the case for North Country Trail, the blaze is bright blue. In general, the trail is well-groomed, but there are sections of loose rock and larger rocks that slow your pace.

The trail starts by taking you over Hidden River Bridge before crossing the bike path and N. Shore Drive. Once over the road, you start the first of many climbs. Continue following the blazes over several roads, around one small pond, and past the marina on your way to the end of this section at Route 528, near the bridge crossing over Lake Arthur.

Once you cross Route 528, you'll be presented with a 300-foot climb to the top of a ridge, which offers a nice view of Lake Arthur in fall and winter when the leaves have dropped. There are several stretches of open space as you climb which also give glimpses of the lake.

The next 5 miles are similar to the first 8. You'll make 3 climbs along singletrack trail which is primarily smooth with occasional sections of loose rock.

You'll recognize the end of the trail when you reach the Jennings Environmental Center and a uphill slope of flower beds. The end of the Glacier Ridge Trail does not mark the end of the North Country Trail, which continues on to Allegheny National Forest, and all the way to the New England states.

1.8,Point to Point,1509,458,57,1052,12,32,Blue Dot Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        While the Blue Blaze Trail is one of the more arduous trails in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, the opportunities for striking views along the way make it all worthwhile. 

Starting at the summit of Mount Tammany, near the end of the Red Dot Trail, wander along the forested bluffs of Mount Tammany for a half-mile, before turning northwest and beginning a considerable descent through beautiful hardwood forests. During the fall and winter, watch your step as the descent can often be covered in slippery, wet leaves. 

After a mile of descending, the trail grades soften, allowing visitors to fully enjoy nearby Dunnfield Creek. At the junction with the Appalachian Trail (AT), continue south, following the trail downhill toward the parking area.

Counter-clockwise: From the end of Fish Run, make a right. You'll be in for a very rocky, but manageable descent. On your way down you'll cross over Quarry Rd and eventually end up in Linn Run Campground. Make a left and follow the campground road to get the next section of Grove Run. This section will be a switchback climb that is rocky and narrow.  At the end of your 1.75 mile climb, you'll have a choice on how to return. You can go straight across Quarry Rd and make a right on Fish Run Tr to double back Fish Run or make a right on Quarry Rd, then a left on Weaver Rd and a left on Hickory Flats Rd to get to the top of Linn Run Rd. A right on Linn Run Rd will take you to Wolf Rocks Parking lot in less than a mile.

Clockwise: From the end of Fish Run a left is made on Grove Run. In less than 1/4 mile you cross over Quarry Rd. Be prepared for a rocky descent that will include tight switchbacks, rocky stream crossings and benchcut singletrack that is very narrow. After a 1.75 mile downhill you'll enter Linn Run Campground. Once in the campground you'll have to carefully watch for the continuation of Grove Run Trail on your right. When you find the trail, be prepared for a tough climb. Initially the rocks may make it challenging. After crossing Quarry Rd you'll hit uphill rocky sections, however, these are short lived. You'll eventually end the loop back at Fish Run Trail. From there you can make a left and double back Fish Run or go straight and make lefts on Quarry Rd, Weaver Rd and Hickory Flats Rd to get to the top of Linn Run Rd.

14.8,Point to Point,1151,842,429,582,1,16,West Penn Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        The West Penn Trail is officially recognized as a National Recreation Trail and is a beautiful, accessible route for anyone in the area. The trail stretches between Saltsburg to just outside Blairsville along the path of the old Portage Railroad line that ran from 1830 to 1864. 

This line was originally built to connect Pittsburgh and Harrisburg. The trail is still under development in an effort to extend it further along the railroad path. For updated conditions and route information, check the Conemaugh Valley Conservancy website.

The trail is comprised of five sections. The first is at Conemaugh River Lake, near the Conemaugh Dam, where the trail heads across four stone arch bridges that date back to the early 1900s.

The second section is the Bow Ridge Switchback to Conemaugh Dam Section. Here, the trail passes two tunnels and a hydroelectric plant with some elevation that can be a great, aerobic challenge for riders.

The third section is the Dick Mayer section that follows the former railroad bed and has some challenging crushed gravel and rough, wooded singletrack. 

The penultimate section is Saltsburg and this stretch of the trail goes along the banks of the Conemaugh River for just over four miles, heading through shaded woodlands. Be aware as horseback riding and biking are permitted.

The final section is the Kiski Extension, which follows the east riverbank for 1.5 miles until it comes to an open field. Beyond the field, the trail heads onto private property.

4.6,Loop,2752,1852,903,904,7,22,North Loop Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        Accessible from McKenna Trail and Painter Rock Trail (via a connector), the North Loop Trail is a rugged 5 mile loop with 1000 feet of climbing. There are three elements to this trail: jaggers, rocks/boulders, runs.  Going counterclockwise, the trail begins with a gentle descent, before turning straight down the mountainside at ~15-20% for a quarter mile, and then easing up again. The beginning section of trail, at roughly 2800 feet, is covered in knee-high grasses, similar to McKenna Trail. As you descend the trail, the grasses thin and vanish, before around 2200 feet, jaggers (briars) appear and thicken. This makes the trail a bit tougher to hike because the jaggers are large enough to cut up your legs. You may note a run crossing that cuts the trail diagonally. You'll cross this run later, when it is much larger and rushing downhill.

Around the first mile, the trail takes a significant turn left (south), but there appears to be other options.  Follow the yellow blazes. Very shortly after this turn, the trail makes another hard right, which is miss-able.  Small logs and sticks are dragged across the trail to mark the turn. If you stay straight the trail becomes noticeably less ""maintained"" and you'll not see any yellow blazes.

It is very shortly after these series of turns that you'll come to a brief section with boulders on either side of the trail and look like monuments. It's a nice reprieve from the jaggers and monotony of the trail.  

Once at the bottom of the mountain, the trail slowly begins rising. You'll cross two streams at this point. The first stream you'll have crossed earlier, and has grown as it picks up more water. The other stream originates within the loop. Roaring Run Natural Area contains several natural springs. Note the clarity of the water.

The final big turn marks the start of the 1000 foot climb. Unlike the descent, it is less steep and can be hike in many of the sections. There is a connector trail to take you to Painter Rock Trail about mid-way up the climb.

You'll arrive back at the loop start with McKenna Trail to the right.

1.4,Point to Point,1650,1436,194,215,5,10,Penny Run Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Both trailheads are found along the park road. The northern trailhead is tucked under trees with a small wooden bridge marking the entrance. The southern trailhead has a metal gate and looks like a fire access road. Once on the trail, it quickly turns to doubletrack mixed with singletrack. The trail has lots of smaller rocks and roots, but nothing notable.  

Starting at the southern trailhead, hikers climb the entire way to the 90-degree turn in the trail. The climb is gentle and the trail is smooth enough to make it very manageable. The turn marks the end of significant climbs; although there is a slight uphill, it is insignificant. Hikers will be able to see out ahead since the trail is so straight in this section and the tree canopy is high. At the end of the straight-away, hikers make another 90-degree turn, this time heading back down the hill paralleling Penny Run.

Once out of the woods, hikers can head to the campgrounds for the Nature Trail or Lowlands Trail or head towards the park office for some rugged singletrack on the north side of the lake (Adams Run, Orchard Trail, and Hunters Ridge).

The trail is well-kept and begins along the lake where you can enjoy waterfowl and other types of birds.   There are several nesting boxes along the way as well. 

This trail has both a short and long loop. About 1/4 mile in you bump into the only significant incline but it can be a doozy for new hikers or the elderly.  

After the climb into the hillside, the scenery is close with no real vistas.   There are some great stands of pines that are definitely worth experiencing though.  

This is a loop trail and will return you to the parking area.

***IMPORTANT***  This trail is supposed to be marked with PINK blazes according to the state park map.  However, it has been remarked with DARK BLUE blazes.   The trail also appears to have undergone some redesigning.  There are some intersecting paths and offshoots but the blue blazes are easy to follow and well-marked.

This parking area is next to the Pawlings Rd bridge over the Schuylkill.  If you are parked at the Pawlings Road Trail to the east and near 422, you are at the wrong spot. While similar in name, this trail is NOT the Schuylkill River Trail - Pawlings to Lock 60.

From the trailhead, follow the crushed gravel path down river 3 miles.  Along the way, you'll find several views of the Schuylkill River to your right.  You'll pass the site of Sullivan's Bridge, part of the Valley Forge encampment, where George Washington's Army took shelter during the winter of 1777-1778.  

At the beginning of the trail, a large earthen mound is to your left.  This is the impoundment for the Walnut Hill Desilting Basin, an additional trail is available on top of the berm. In other sections of the trail, multiple wetlands areas are present on your left. In the winter, expect to find ducks and geese.  In Spring look for frogs and salamanders.

The best view on this trail is right at the start, at the junction with the Blue Dot Trail—hike south down the ridge about 50 feet to a rock outcropping. 

From the start, the trail heads northeast, paralleling the Appalachian Trail. As a reasonably level old road through the woods, it is a well defined path, but can be narrow at times.

About halfway along the trail, you'll see an open field which is the site of a Heliport used by the fire service. After about 3.0 miles, the road intersects with the Turquoise Trail which cuts through a valley and past Sunfish Pond to connect with the AT. Currently the trail is crossed with down logs at the intersection with the Turquoise Trail (though they may not remain), so be on the lookout for the Turquoise Trail intersection. The Mt. Tammany Fire Road continues to the Yards Creek Reservoir which is private property. If you continue past the Turquoise Trail, you'll have to turn around at the boundary and retrace your steps.

Trail overall is in good shape, well blazed and easy to follow. The closer you get to the waterfall, the climbing is foot AND hand, meaning you'll need legs and hands to safely get closer to the waterfall as they're large boulders. I visited in November 2020 so there was very little water. In spring, it'll be a different story as is the case in Winter as it'll start freezing up over time.

0.6,Point to Point,1233,1045,187,153,11,28,Spur Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        Enter the trail from Brown Road at the start of a section of guard rail. The trail follows a stream making several crossings. In spring, this section of trail is full of wildflowers.

The trail then makes a sharp turn, covering over 100 feet of gain in less than a quarter mile. At the top of the climb you'll come to a grassy patch of forest with a fork in the trail. The trail to the right is the North Trails section. Stay left to stay on the Spur Trail. From here, the trail dives, losing all the elevation gained in the same amount of distance.

You'll end at a Blue Door and the Braille Trail.

3.4,Point to Point,1166,1128,79,93,1,4,Figure 8 Trail (500),Intermediate,4.0,"        Figure 8 Trail is Trail 500 on legacy maps. 

Primary access is via the dirt fire road road on the south side of Knowlton Rd, and the road narrows to doubletrack. Look for the trail to branch off to the right to follow the route - you'll end up back on the doubletrack at the end of the hike. 

There is an alternative connector signed for access to the Figure 8 Trail off Knowleton Rd, on MTB Project as  Figure 8 Trail - Knowleton Road Connector, which is a good exit, but not a great entrance to the trail due to steep grade uphill from Knowleton Rd to the Figure 8 Trail. 

You'll encounter a section where the trails cross at a 4-way intersection, thus the name, Figure 8. Just proceed straight through the intersection, and you'll eventually loop around and come back through. This applies no matter whether you're going clockwise or counterclockwise.

There is a lot of dried pine needle cover on the ground and hilly terrain, these trails drain well and can be used shortly after rainfall without much mud.

Not far from the trailhead, there is an incredibly steep section. If the water is low enough or there is a rock bridge, it's sometimes possible to cross the stream quite easily.

About a mile in, the rocks become more sparse and the trail becomes less technical. At about 2 miles from the parking lot, the trail meets up with Sand Spring Trail and the Sand Spring campsite.

The rail line used to transport visitors and good from the main Pennsylvania line. With the decline of rail travel, the railroad eventually passed into history, but this great trail remains. 

Visitors to the trail will enjoy the gentle grades, and the lush, shaded terrain. The trail is located at the bottom of one of the most diverse creeks in Pennsylvania, a fact that can be seen even from this popular route. Along the way, visitors will pass through dense hemlock thickets, and make their way under various types of hardwoods. Eventually the heavily wooded portions will open up into scenic meadows, which are the perfect place to stop for a picnic or a snack.

1.1,Point to Point,1449,1192,257,220,8,22,Longfellow Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        This trail is the main trail that runs through the Forest Cathedral Natural Area in Cook Forest State Park. It is blazed with a blue and yellow rectangle. The trail begins branching off of the Toms Run Trail and climbs steadily as it enters into the old-growth. As it continues the passive management of the forest almost makes it feel as though you are entering into the forest moon of Endor.  

As it climbs it passes junctions with various other trails through this area. Once the trail levels off these are some wonderful opportunities to view the treetops of the enormous trees. The trail then turns to the left and drops steeply. Here, there are exceptional views as the grade of the trail allows you to see full trees right in front of you. 

Eventually, the trail flattens out and turns to the right. The rest of the trail is a slight and scenic descent. On the right, as the trail nears its terminus, there are both a memorial fountain and a plaque designating this area a National Natural Landmark. The trail then ends in the parking lot for the Log Cabin Inn Environmental Education Center.

We call Ranger our bellwether trail because it gives a pretty indication of how the rest of the system is holding up. If Ranger is sloppy then turn around and head home because the rest of the trails are likely just as bad. If most of Ranger is in good shape then you're probably good to go!

Over 3 miles of up and down, this trail rolls nicely through an old junkyard, house foundation, and Nikks Big Banana.  When people hike this, they might get to the bottom and say, ""Man I cant wait to do this entire trail again!""

Kitchen Sink starts off of Up & Out Loop. Hang a right and head up the side of the mountain. It looks horrible, but once you get to the top the trail is rolling all the way to the 3D climb.  Climb that and youll be on your way to some really easy well-maintained trails. Be sure to enjoy the wildlife while youre up there. You'll encounter deer and squirrels, so make sure youre paying attention. Continue onwards and youll end up at the Old Access Road. From there, climb to the top of the Access Road, and make sure you play around on the old House Foundation.  

After the foundation, youll hit some really easy trail until you get to the old junkyard. Watch your step; youre in an old junkyard. From here you'll have two more small, but lung busting climbs before you hit the final descent.  Slog up those two and youre almost home-free. Once you're at the bottom, you'll meet up with the Up & Out Loop. Hike that back to the parking area!

With over 14 parking areas variably spaced along the route, the McDade Recreational Trail provides all users with an appropriate length of trail. Parking areas can be as close as half a mile, and as far as five miles apart.

For those wishing to travel along the trail one-way, the National Park Service funds a free weekend bus service that stops at many major trailheads along the route. To view the schedule, click here.

Be aware that there are no services along the route, so be sure to bring all the food and water you'll need along with you. 

While the terrain is variable along the trail, each section exhibits a distinct nature: some are flat ribbons of gravel along the river, while others climb up the valley walls, and some are in between. 

Regardless of the section traveled, visitors to the McDade Recreational Trail are bound to have a wonderful and enriching experience along the banks of the Delaware.

Trail Segments are described below: 

From Hialeah Trailhead to Owens Trailhead, the trail traverses gently graded pastoral farmlands, complete with paint-peeling fences and rustic out-buildings.From Owens Trailhead to the park headquarters, the trail leaves the river's flood plane and climbs steeply up the valley walls through densely forested switchback turns.From the park headquarters to Bushkill Access, visitors will wander along rolling terrain, while keeping eyes peeled for the crumbling foundations of buildings constructed in a bygone era.From Bushkill Access to Milford Beach, the trail skirts the Delaware on a thin slice of land before leveling out near Schneider Farm, where it continues along gentle grades to Milford Beach.

9.4,Point to Point,2743,1883,1377,1448,6,21,Whitetail Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        One of the most notable trails in western Pennsylvania due to its length and combination of challenging ascents, fun descents and ""deep in the forest"" feel. The trail actually parallels Skyline road along the ridge top, so the remote feeling is a bit of an illusion.  There is also a not-to-be-missed view point just before the final descent to the Lick Hollow Picnic area.

There are multiple options for how to set it up as a loop hike. One option is Quebec Odyssey which uses road hiking for the return.  

Whitetail starts at the North parking area of the Quebec Run area, which also has trailheads for Hess Trail and Miller Trail. The first real stream crossing is at Long Run, where the Long Run trail goes off to the right. Instead cross the stream continuing with a long climb up the other side. As it tops out, there will be a short descent then a pipeline cut crossing. After awhile, the trail crosses Skyline road where you'll pass a parking area that could be used for shuttles. After the road crossing, the trail is exceptionally fun as it twists and turns through trees, roots and rocks. The next notable feature is the descent to Redstone creek, where you end up on an old logging road. At this point look for the singletrack down to the creek crossing (don't hike down the road). 

After crossing the creek, there will be some climbing before you arrive at a doubletrack which you need to descend on for awhile. Continue on with the descent following the blazes alongside and looking for the point where the singletrack continues off to the right. Shortly thereafter you'll arrive at the junction with Pine Knob Trail. Just before the final descent to the right on Pine Knob trail, take the left to check out the Pine Knob overlook. Then return to the descent to Lick Hollow Picnic area. This descent is challenging fun. The Lick Hollow Picnic area is nicely situated with ample parking and toilets.

4.7,Point to Point,1575,970,133,707,3,14,Raccoon Run Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        The biggest difficulty was finding the trail. The easiest access point to this 4.7 mile section is from the southern terminus. There is parking on the north side of the road, just after turning past Snowy Mountain Rd, while staying on 233. Look for a sign on the north side of the road (about 200 after right turn) with directions to the AT and Raccoon Run Trail. The trees are marked with blue blazes. 

The trail begins with a slightly rocky start before crossing over to the east side of 233, where it remains for this entire section. After crossing 233, expect another crossing over the Rocky Mountain Creek. The bridge is in good condition and did not show any signs of aging. A quick left turn after the bridge, and you'll begin the main leg of the trail moving northward, following 233. 

The trail has some slight gains and losses of elevation with nothing more than 3-5% for the first few miles. This is a great warm up section if you plan on hiking the length of the trail and back. We did this trail on February 13 and conditions here were sometimes not ideal. Certain areas were a little flooded (no higher than the ankle) due to snowmelt. 

After crossing one logging road, a second road crossing is needed. The trail picks up on other corner of the bridge. The last mile of the trail was the most difficult. There can be icy conditions due to being on the shaded side of the mountain among lots of evergreen trees. Here, hikers will encounter the biggest changes in elevation.

9.8,Point to Point,2451,1222,1779,1076,6,38,Tuscarora Trail Section 7: Cowan's Gap State Park to PA 16,Difficult,4.0,"        The Bird Run Shelter looks nearly new with a clean composting toilet -- clearly doesn't get much use. It is about 6 miles to Cowan's Gap State Park, where you can catch a shower, go for a swim, relax on the sandy beach, refill water bottles, and eat a meal at the concession. Immediately exiting the parking lot headed south, the trail crosses the road and climbs about 600 feet.  

It is roughly 5 miles to the The Big Mountain Shelter, which again appears relatively clean and rarely used. The fire pit is surrounded by large stones skillfully arranged like furniture and a spring fills a small pond about 200 yards to the south. About 0.75 miles uphill is the Big Mountain overlook, which is a spectacular site to catch a sunrise or gaze at the stars. The hang gliding ramps at Route 30, about 3 to 4 miles further, provide a scenic view to the west.

2.1,Point to Point,1793,1134,117,698,7,20,Astronomy Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        The best access for this trail begins at Gilbert Road. Driving along Ridge Road from Shippensburg Road, you'll find parking for 6 vehicles near the power line. The map shows the intersecting road as Fegley Road but the trail signs on Ridge Road indicate it is Gilbert Road. Proceed under the power lines 1/4 mile to an open area. Look for a sign post for Astronomy Trail to the right of the grassy area. There are occasional red blazes. 

From here, the trail remains fairly level on hard packed soil, passing through open woodland with acres of blueberry bushes and mountain laurel. The trail becomes narrow in places from the overgrowth. At 1.5-miles, the trail begin a rocky descent to Milesburn Road within sight of Baltimore Rd. There is a private driveway across the street and possibly space for 2 cars in a pull off spot on Milesburn Rd.

There is a nice pavilion at the east end of the trail for picnics. Shortly after the start of the trail, you'll see a small waterfall on Meeks Run. There are two small creek crossings along the trail where you'll need to hop across rocks. Having waterproof shoes and a walking stick can be helpful. 

If you start at Hassam Road, you'll take a Connector Trail, which will end up taking you through a wetland on top of a boardwalk.

This trail is blazed blue, but not well, though it's not hard to follow the trail without the blazes. 

You can pick up other trails in the conservation area such as the Powerline Trail, Oil Well Trail, Cave Trail, and the Honeydew Trail.

47.9,Loop,2327,1081,7771,7737,6,27,Chuck Keiper Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        The Chuck Keiper Trail is a 50 mile backpacking trail in the remote Pennsylvania Wilds.  The trail can be done as one larger 50 mile loop or use the East Branch trail to create a 31 mile or 24 mile option. Starting from the main parking area on Rt. 144, across from swamp branch rd., hike the trail in a counterclockwise direction.  

The first couple of miles start off pretty mellow before dropping down into the first big decent into the Fish Dam Wild Area.  Hike to the stream and then climb out via a short, steep climb.  Next you'll drop down into the Burns Run Wild Area.  This is a long decent to the stream with a long and steep ascent out of the wild area.  Next, the trail leads to the Yost Run area.  It is a long, gradual ascent out of Yost Run.  You'll be rewarded with a series of waterfalls toward the end of Yost Run.  Cross Rt. 144 at an alternate trailhead parking area and then begin a decent into the Eddy Lick area.  You'll meander along Eddy Lick and come across several remnants of the old logging era.  

After Eddy Lick enjoy a long stretch of  moderate terrain that mostly follows old logging roads.  At approximately mile 28 the Chuck Keiper intersects the East Branch Trail.  You can take this trail to cut the larger loop in half.  Continue hiking the rolling terrain to the Cranberry Swamp area.  Take the loop around Cranberry Swamp or bypass if you want to cut some mileage.  Next head into a smaller drainage with a moderate climb to Mill Run Rd.  After crossing Mill Run, drop into the steeper Boggs Run area. Hike along Boggs Run for sever miles before climbing out and coming to a vista once you cross Peters Run Rd.  

Next drop into another drainage and cross Rt. 144 again.  Descend into the final drainage of the hike and follow the stream for a while before climbing out to join Barneys Ridge Rd.  Take a short side trip to Big Rocks Vista.  After a little road hiking, veer to the right and back to the parking lot. Finish with the great vista from the parking lot.  PA DCNR provides a good trail map or there is a detail trail guide by Dave Gantz.

From Buckskin Trail, the Camp Trail falls down the hillside to cross over a small creek with an immediate jump up the opposite hillside. Here, you'll find a pair of stone structures. The trail juts right and continues along the hillside all the way to the dam before crossing a park road and finishing up at the dam parking lot.

While hiking along the hillside, you'll have plenty of opportunity to look out over the valley floor and the creek that winds its way through. While only a 100 feet up, it's a great section that takes your mind away from hiking.

10.8,Point to Point,662,536,164,54,0,1,Cumberland Valley Rail Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        This crusher fine rail trail takes hikers from Newville to Shippensburg and vice-versa. If you're looking for a mellow out-and-back hike, look no further than the CVRT.

Though this trail is buffered by trees in some areas, you'll have expansive views of South Mountain and Blue Mountain for nearly this trail's entirety. The folds of the surrounding Appalachian topography are very apparent from this vantage.

In addition to these Appalachian mountains, you'll note that almost every property this trail rolls through is a farm. This valley is so filled with farms because of its flat topography, access to water, and its limestone-rich geology.

Soils formed from limestone-rich rock is subsequently rich in calcium carbonate. This soil component improves the nutrient uptake of plants by increasing the pH of the soil. This also affects water penetration of the soil and provides plants with calcium and magnesium.

Throughout the trail, it crosses several bridges. However, the first bridge (at the time of writing) is closed because of structural issues and, thus, requires a mildly tricky crossing via stepping stones. It continues along the run and gives views of both old-growth trees and a landscape that has been very passively managed. The trail is well maintained, but is not, in fact, marked. The terminus of the trail is across a swing bridge that traverses the run. This is a nice and somewhat hidden feature that is fun for the whole family.

3.8,Point to Point,504,444,155,165,2,9,Angler's Access Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        This trail is a multi-use trail. Didn't see too many people walking the trail when I went. The trail is a loop that can be travelled in either direction. One direction will give you smooth uphills and trickier downhills while the other direction gives you trickier climbs and smooth downhills. 

The technical climbs are somewhat steep with large roots making the footing difficult. There are also wooden bridges to cross along the trail. 

The trail has two areas that lead you to the main road for a brief period and then puts you back onto the actual trail again. The trail is marked with blue paint or wooden signs with a blue mark.  

There are a few logs as well, but these have a little dirt ramp to make getting over a little easier. About a quarter-mile of the trail is on the park side, which is open area with gravel for the trail. There are pavilions and bathrooms as well.

1.7,Point to Point,1608,1525,30,99,1,4,Laurel Run Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        This trail begins at the boardwalk at the south end of Parker Lake. As it follows the boardwalk it zigzags over a shallow marsh. While it is bowed and in need of small repairs, it is a nice place to hike. Here is an opportunity to view the various wildlife alive in the lake including salamanders and small fish.  

After leaving the boardwalk, the trail transitions into a nice dirt path along the lake. When I did this trail, as we made this transition a bald eagle leaped from the branches above us and soared over the lake.  As it continues, there is a pine grove where the path widens to include a small group of rock formations. As the trail curves at the north end of the lake, it passes rocks that have been laid out to spell ""Parker Dam"" on the ground.

The trail then continues over the berm of the mostly earthen, CCC-era dam. To the right, just in the lake is a structure that supports a bat box.  Next, the trail comes to the part of the dam over which Laurel Run flows. This part of the dam is fairly ingenious as instead of a traditional bridge, a large area of steppingstones has been placed to accommodate for the movement of both visitors and the stream. The trail crosses these stones and climbs up stairs on the other side of the dam.

After the dam, the trail ventures into a more wooded section of the park.  This is the first time where the yellow blazes that mark the trail are both visible and necessary. The rest of the trail continues fairly flat and near the river, though there are some places that are overgrown and muddy.  This is a generally pleasant second half of the trail. The terminus of the trail is the bridge that crosses over Laurel Run.

Start at the top of Woodrow Road and turn east. After about 100 yards, there will will be an open section with a doubletrack to the right and a trail into the woods on the left. Head up the doubletrack a little ways and the start of the downhill will be (somewhere) on your right. Make sure to use the Hiking Project mobile app to help find the way.

The trail starts out with the hardest section first with a steep and rocky section where you'll want to watch your footing. After that, the trail doesn't flatten out, but it gets a bit easier until ending at the SWMA #8 Haul Road.

You'll see evidence of the routes that cyclists have been using, but use caution as these can be slick on foot. It's a great trail, with your fun only limited by your risk aversion (common sense?).

It is best navigated from the Allegheny Front Trail (North) intersection to Headwaters Trail as this provides the better downhill.

There is also a connector with a bridge over Quebec Run to cross back to the Mill Run Trail about half way. 

The trail features sustained climbing in the north to south direction. The loamy soil drains well in wet weather. Expect a few creek crossings from tributaries to Quebec Run.

1.9,Point to Point,2044,1304,742,2,8,15,Bear Run Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        NOTE: Not to be confused with the Bear Run Nature Trail some miles west.

The trail starts across Landrus Road from a small parking area, which is notable for a plaque dedicated to the former Village of Landrus. (A connecting path north of the road leads to MST - Section 18.) The first 50 feet or so of the trail is wide enough for a car, and this width continues on a small spur to the right (west), where there is a small clearing with a fire pit. 

After the spur, the trail is singletrack and sparsely marked with very faded red blazes.Terrain is generally fairly rocky. The trail runs uphill in the Bear Run valley, passing a couple of waterfalls. Just under 1 mile from the road, the trail actually crosses Bear Run twice, which might cut your hike short depending on how much rain the area has received recently. Eventually, the trail separates from Bear Run and continues through woods, and becomes less steep. The trail terminates on the top of Hickory Ridge, where the Long Run Railroad Trail meets Bloss Mountain Road.

You'll hear buzzing coming from the Model Airplane Airport nearby and wonder if it's someone running a chainsaw in the distance.

These are less maintained than some of the other trails here, and may be hard to traverse in the heavy growth months.  Wear some pants and gloves, because the Jaggers will get you.

1.3,Point to Point,227,168,84,69,2,6,Pickering Ice Dam Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        The Pickering Creek Dam Trail has some historical significance, as back in the 1900's they would dam up the area in the winter in order to collect ice which would be shipped to Philadelphia. The trail is relatively flat, and obstacle free, with an old bridge in the middle to get across the creek. 

There is a second trail that runs along the top of the ridge, once you cross the bridge near Bird Ln. The upper trail runs parallel to a housing development, and the trail to get there is fairly steep. One section even has a rope to help you get up over a small ridge, which can be a big icy/slippery during the winter months. Expect to see dog-walkers, nature photographers, and trout fisherman along the trail.

2.0,Point to Point,2922,2798,137,157,3,11,Airport Island,Difficult,4.0,"        One way to start this trail is to park at the resort and hike past the lake and then onto Tahoe Drive where the trail becomes obvious on the side of Tahoe Drive. Another way is to come up the 24 hour race climb and turn right at the top onto the singletrack just before you reach Airport Road.

As shown, the trail parallels Airport Road and goes onto the ""island"" section, which has a few interesting boulders to navigate. 

From the start, the trail mostly follows the contour with short bits of ascending and descending. Eventually, you'll come out on a doubletrack. Cross it to stay on the singletrack. 

This is the ""island"" part, stay to your left at the first junction and the trail will wrap around bringing you back out to the doubletrack. Here, if you again cross the road, you can hike a very short singletrack extension that brings you back to the road again. Turn right and head out to the end of the old runway avoiding some large puddles. 

At the end, you gain access to the Big Fern Loop, which is a loop trail that goes out to Dumbauld Road and back. You'll likely hear target practice in this area.

Named for the moss phlox that blooms each April, Pink Hill is a serpentine barren: an ecosystem with an underlying bedrock with high levels of toxic nickel and an imbalance of magnesium and calcium.

This trail departs from the Scenic Loop. It is marked by a small sign that you must be looking for, but also by a pink bench (far easier to see).

3.1,Point to Point,1812,1517,293,412,4,19,Black Gap Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        Black Gap Trail is one of the ""must do"" trails in the area. It's broken roughly into thirds and is often referred to as West, Middle and East sections by locals. The Middle section is wet for much of the year and might be worth skipping, unless you really want a challenge. And by wet, I don't mean muddy. The entire trail follows a drainage for a couple of vernal pools in the middle section and if there has been any rain, the middle section is more of a creek than a trail. It's all stone though, so it's pretty much only yourself that you're hurting. 

The preferred direction is from west to east. The trail starts off climbing up from Engle Road through a hemlock grove and is pretty open. Soon though the trail becomes a tunnel though rhododendron and mountain laurel, making for a very cool hike. This continues for about a mile until it intersects with the Handicapped Access Trail (referred to by locals by its original name, Jamboree Trail.) If you want to skip the middle section, go right and take the doubletrack for over a mile. 
The eastern third was re-routed in 2011 and has some rocky bits before dropping into the creek bed to finish out the trail. Be careful crossing the bridges as they can be slick.

The main entrance to the trail is to the left at the entry way at Old Frankstown Road and exits onto the sidewalk near the lower parking loop for the Wave Pool.  

A good way to connect this trail is to follow the White Blaze Blue Dot trail from the log cabin to the Orange Blaze White Dot trail and cross Old Frankstown Road to the main trail entrance. 

After you exit the Wave Pool Trail, then follow the road back towards Old Frankstown Road and look for a clearing on the left towards the skate park and there will be a small un-blazed connector trail, Wave Pool Trail Connector, which will take you down to the corner of Cooper Road and Old Frankstown Road.

3.3,Point to Point,2065,1898,213,114,2,8,Frank Gantz Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        The Frank Gantz Trail is rated moderately difficult for hiking, so trail running is quite challenging due to the rocky terrain. If the ground is wet, the rocks can be extremely slippery and running would not be wise. 

The trail connects with the Lakeside Trail around Tobyhanna, which is an easy five-mile loop, and therefore the two trails can be coupled together for an ~11-mile run departing and returning to Gouldsboro State Park. Requires a reasonably slow pace in parts given the uneven and rocky terrain, but it is great fun if you like the challenge. 

The trail feels quite remote but is well-marked.

The trail gains most of its elevation in the first 1/3 of the route, but continues gradually uphill for its entire length. Enjoy the lush, forested path past rock formations and small clearings. Just over halfway, the steep Wolfinger Trail descends to the east. Continue northwest along the Mount Misery Trail to its terminus at the Horse-Shoe Trail.

While you're near the Covered Bridge, take a moment to appreciate this historical landmark.

2.1,Loop,1028,953,133,141,3,12,Kildoo Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.6,"        The Kildoo Trail starts at the covered bridge and dam and runs south to Eckert Bridge. There aren't any spurs off the trail and it is blazed well-enough that you won't get lost.

This trail is tough to hike with the boulders and roots, but it has access to large boulders sitting within the rapids and creek, offering some vantage points not gotten from the Slippery Rock Gorge Trail.

6.5,Point to Point,1155,864,766,626,4,14,Forest Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.6,"        This trail is accessible from the main parking lot at the base of the spillway (eastern trailhead) or off the Appaloosa Trail.  Starting from the spillway, this trail runs across the basin before heading up to the ridgeline via a stream.  Once on the ridge you'll inevitably descend and rise crossing several streams as you make you way west.  

This trail is singletrack with several road crossings which normally don't present much difficulty getting across.  The trail is muddy in the hollows and has roots and ruts most of the way.

3.3,Point to Point,892,833,75,22,1,2,Spring Creek Canyon Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.7,"        This trail follows the Fish Commission doubletrack from the hatchery in Bellefonte to the one at Shiloh Rd along Spring Creek. Between Shiloh Rd and the Rock Rd parking area, it is a singletrack. Often, you'll encounter fisherman walking along the path/doubletrack to their favorite spots.

This is a great place to get kids into the outdoors. If there is enough snow in winter, you'll also encounter XC skiers and snowshoers.

Use the parking area off Rock Rd, the parking access off Shiloh Rd, or the parking access off Spring Creek Rd.

4.5,Point to Point,1467,1200,477,287,3,25,Wyggeston Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        If you start from the south you'll notice the elevation because you'll be going up...north. This route is not a loop trail, so to hike the full trail and get back to your car, you'll have to return the way you came. If the full 7+ mile outing seems like a bit much for one day, you can bring two cars, and leave one at the southern trailhead where the trail starts, and another at the northern trailhead. 

The way is marked by yellow or golden color trail I.D. blazes. Some of the blazes have faded a little in the southern section of the trail, so keep an eye out. The northernmost part of this trail does offer a loop section from the north trailhead, and this portion has golden with white blazes, distinguishing it is a loop trail.

There are park forest roads and other unmarked trails in the area, but if you focus on following the blazes, you'll stay on track.

1.5,Loop,1120,1000,147,148,4,22,Lockhart Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        The best way to enter the trail is from the Guyasuta Trail, which is accessed off Squaw Run Road in the valley. The loop is easy to follow. Going clockwise from the Guyasuta Trail, you'll weave and climb to a road (Trillium Lane).  

Here is the only ""tricky"" part. You'll see two roads: one with a brick structure splitting the lanes, and another that is cinder with a metal gate across it. Take the metal gate road; there are signs that indicate it is the Lockhart Trail (aka dog walking path). You'll head down the fire road for a hundred feet or so before a sign (on your right) will indicate the trail turns left off the road, down a few stone steps.  Continue on the trail from here.

In general, the trail is really nice and as you make your way around the loop, you'll come to a stretch of large stone steps which are unique. A section of the trail follows along the hillside with a great view in the fall with colors from the trees across the valley and above Squaw Run.

2.8,Point to Point,1566,1184,436,287,5,11,Meadow Run Trail,Intermediate,3.6,"        The main access to this trail is at the Cucumber Falls parking lot with a second lot at the end of Kentuck Road. From Cucumber Falls, the trail starts with rocky terrain at the base of the falls, and then follows along the Yough riverfront for approximately a quarter mile. There are chances to stop and enjoy watching rafters make their way around Fern Cliff.

At the mouth of Meadow Run, the trail turns to follow along the stream for a half mile. Here the trail forks, creating the lollipop. Taking the trail to the right will begin the climb to the top of the hill immediately. Taking the trail to the left will follow at the foot of the hill before making the climb. The climb itself is steep and rocky.

The return trip offers another glimpse of rafters on the Yough. The trail doesn't access other trails aside from Great Gorge Trail.

2.4,Loop,1103,930,188,184,3,16,Green Loop,Intermediate,3.8,"        Trail access can be found via one of the multiple connectors around the Iroquois shelter area. The Green Loop shares trail with the Blue Loop for a section.  

There are two distinct sections to this loop: The upper section and the valley section. The upper section is standard dirt singletrack that's well blazed, and well-groomed. The valley section starts and ends with a steep descent and climb. When in the valley itself, the trail becomes more difficult with fallen trees, debris, and multiple stream crossings.  However at the northern end of this trail section you'll be treated by a small waterfall.

2.7,Point to Point,846,699,202,302,4,12,Trail #15,Intermediate,3.8,"        Trail #15 is long and rocky, so just watch your footing. This trail was originally built by mountain bikers, so at no point along this trail is there any need to climb over large rocks. During the last ice age, PA was the terminus of the ice sheet and this is one of the more southern trails that showcases that geologic feature. There are numerous areas of very large boulders seemingly placed there by the hands of the gods. There are also multiple dead end spur trails that lead to rock climbing areas.
    ",PA
3.8,Point to Point,2734,2449,300,433,4,8,Fish Run Trail,Difficult,3.8,"        Fish Run Trail starts at the main parking lot of the Wolf Rock trailhead. The first section of trail was built by LHORBA. There is a fun mix of challenging rocky sections gardens and smooth singletrack until the trail makes a left at a T and follows an old service road. This section has grown into a smooth singletrack. 

A few hundred yards before Linn Run Road, the trail will make a 90 degree right and twist and turn until it meets up with the original part of Fish Run. There is a bailout point here on your left where Hickory Flats Rd meets Linn Run Rd. To take the bailout would be a mistake since you would miss arguably the best trail at Laurel Highlands. This original section of Fish Run is level to downhill for about 1.75 miles. The narrow singletrack follows a scenic stream, the namesake of the trail, through rocks and gradual twists and turns on less technical sections. 

You'll pass Hobblebush Trail on your right before continuing the descent to Linn Run Rd. Please be very cautious on the short drop onto Linn Run Rd. The trail is very washed out, loose and steep and there may be cars traveling the road.

When you hit Linn Run Rd. you have the choice of making a left on the road to return to the Wolf Run parking lot to access Picnic Trail or Wolf Rocks Trail or, for a longer hike, cross the road and continue on Fish Run Trail. 

At the road crossing, another leg of the trail continues downhill along the far side of the road. This leg is the remains of the PW&S logging railroad, but is not used because it simply dead ends ahead. The trail to Grove Run stays to the left as a sweeping uphill curve which originally served as a runaway train ramp during those logging days prior to the Park. A couple other small spurs drop off to the right along the climb but these are not used either.

If you continue on the Fish Run Trail, be prepared for rocky sections on a much less traveled trail. The trail will eventually end at a T on Grove Run Trail. A left on Grove Run, a left on Quarry Rd, a left on Weaver Rd and a left on Hickory Flats road will lead you back to Linn Run Rd. just below the Wolf Rocks parking lot. The other option is to stay on Grove Run to Linn Run Campground.

0.8,Point to Point,316,103,222,91,8,22,Neal Thorpe Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        The Neal Thorpe Trail starts at Lock 60 Canal Park.  From the parking area, cross the foot bridge over the Canal and turn left/upriver as if you are on the Upper Schuylkill River Trail.  

Before the trail enters the treeline, a trail sign indicates the Neal Thorpe Trail to the right.  The trail is well established and follows a small gorge upstream.  There are a couple of stream crossings, but each time I have visited, there has been no trouble crossing because of low water or ice.  

Approximately 1/2 mile in, the trail reaches a small open space with a fire pit in it. After this point the trail takes a hard left and climbs up a steep hill with no switchbacks.  Once on top of the hill, the trail is difficult to distinguish from the many other animal and footpaths atop the ravines. Following the largest path (perhaps it's an old logging road) will lead visitors through the trees to the north for approx. 1/4 mile. At this point, the trail will reach an end.  

It has been reported that there is a small path in the narrow section between private houses and steep hillside that allows you to continue  further and rejoin the Upper Schuylkill River Trail farther upstream, but the icy conditions prevented me from searching out the other end.

Once there, continue up to your right and finish the climb. A few more feet and there is another great vista for your viewing pleasure. Work your way across the ridge. Continue down some good descents, then hang a hard right to finish off descending to the gravel road. Head back on the gravel road to the parking area.

1.5,Point to Point,401,121,213,369,7,23,Mount Joy Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        This trail is part of the ""Mount Joy Trail"" cluster. This is the primary path over Mount Joy. The trail is a nice climb/descent with only a few rugged sections. That majority of the trail is crushed gravel surface and is wide enough for two people . The trail starts at the Knox Farm parking area off of Rt 252 in Valley Forge National Park. From the trailhead map in the parking lot, follow the paved Joseph Plumb Martin Trail Northeast until the unpaved Mount Joy Trail .42 miles up.   This switchback will take you on the east side of two soldier bunkhouses.  A path directly up the field on the west side of the bunks is a social trail that cuts the switchback.  Please follow the paved path and help prevent erosion along the unofficial path.

The trail then gradually climbs up through two high points on Mt. Joy, but does not summit them. If you're looking to reach the summit, there are side trails to the top where an observatory used to stand.   Along the way there are several places to look out into Valley Creek and onto the Valley Forge Farms section of the park.  In this section will be General Knox's Quarters (present during encampment), PC Knox Estate (highly modified since encampment), Lord Stirling's Quarters (Modified after encampment) and General LaFayette's Quarters (far to the South-Southwest on the far side of Valley Creek).  


The trail then descends into the valley in which George Washington's Headquarters is situated.  After hiking to the headquarter's end of the trail, add a small bypass look on the return trip by turning left on Mount Joy - East Side Alternate Route.  

A second connector trail, Mount Joy - Joseph Plumb Martin Trail Connector departs the Mount Joy Trail to the East to join up with Joseph Plumb Martin Trail near Artillery Park.

The third option used to be a side loop to an old observatory.  The observatory was removed many years ago and part of the trail has recently been abandoned.  The Mount Joy - Observatory Loop connector still summits Mount Joy, but there is no Observatory and no return loop.  This trail is less maintained, several large steps required at the Mt Joy end of the trail before entering an open field where the observatory had been.  Without the observatory there is no clear view past the trees.  The connector then heads Northeast towards Inner Line Drive and Joseph Plumb Martin Trail.  The original loop is no longer maintained and difficult to pick out.

Trail conditions vary with three distinct sections.  Intermediate overall, but with a smooth middle section and a very rocky far section.  All are relatively level with a gradual overall downhill to the overlook. 

This trail starts at the rear parking area of Laurel Summit State Park adjacent to Fish Run Trail. The first section from the trailhead starts with a short rocky stretch and then meanders over rounded embedded boulders through high laurel to the intersection with Spruce Flats/Hobblebush.  

The middle section from Spruce Flats Trail to the Rector-Eddie Road connector is smoother with a few isolated rocks and some optional log obstacles along the sides of the trail. The last section from the connector to the overlook is increasingly rocky but is manageable all the way back to the overlook.

23.5,Point to Point,187,56,225,291,0,4,Schuylkill River Trail - Conshohocken to Parkersford,Easy,3.7,"        The Schuylkill River Trail will cover approimately 130 miles of the Schuylkill River when completed.  At this point, there are several discontinuous sections available.  This section of the trail is from Conshohocken to Parkersford.  For most of the path, this is paved and 4-8 feet wide.  It typically follows the river, although at times it may track straighter than the river and stray from the river's edge.

This section begins in a commercial/industrial section of Conshohocken.  At the start there is easy access to food, beverage and parking.  Just downriver on the trail (to be mapped still), there is a brewery with trail access.

Going upstream from Conoshohocken, you'll pass a blend of urban suburban, and rural landscapes.  The trail will travel through the edge of Norristown, before entering into Valley Forge National Historical Park (A connector to the park is still under construction, although a temporary wooden walkway is available along the US 422 bridge at Betzwoood Access).

In Valley Forge, the trail is wooded.  If it weren't for paralleling US 422, it would be quiet and serene.  After the trail crosses the Perkiomen Creek, one switchback carries the trail down to stream level near the Confluence of the Perkiomen Creek and Schuylkill River.  The trail continues along the bank of the Schuylkill behind an Industrial area of Oaks before another wooded and  isolated stretch up to Reynold's dog park.

At the Dog Park and downriver end of the Schuylkill Canal, the trail takes a hard S turn around the end of the Schuylkill Canal and continues on the riverside/towpath of the Canal (to be more accurate, it's really a navigation, not a canal).  From here until the Route 29 bridge in Phoenixville the trail is mostly grass/crushed stone.  (There is an onroad option of the trail at this point)

At the Route 29 Bridge, the trail crosses the Schuylkill into Chester County, then follows a few road sections behind Bridge Street (filled with popular shopping and dining options).  A recently opened section of trail continues through the gentle slopes and rural areas of Chester County to the trailhead in Parkersford.  A large portion of the Chester County section is a crushed gravel surface.  At this time, the adjacent section of trail has yet to be completed

1.9,Point to Point,1164,754,443,63,5,19,Witch Hazel Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        Starting at the Boston Ballfield parking area for the Great Allegheny Passage head north on the passage for about 1/2 a mile. While you are getting this nice warm up in pay attention to the big hill to your left, that's the monster you'll soon be climbing. 

Once the gap trail turns into pavement start looking for a left hand trail with a large information board that you'll be turning into. The trail officially begins at the information board. Go past the ruins and when you come to the bridge crossing the creek bear left and continue up the hill. Once you locate the stone stairs you are now at the base of the ""witch"". And trust me this trail is a witch!

You'll now start switch backing up the hill, frankly I lost count of switchbacks after ten. However, the climb continues on beautiful trail, even if it is very challenging.  Pay attention to the blue diamonds with black arrows, they will guide you up the trail.

The views from the top cliff edge are excellent.

3.4,Point to Point,1781,1282,638,207,5,13,Kentuck Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        The Kentuck Trail can be accessed from three distinct points: (1) the Tharp Knob Picnic Area at the southern end, (2) the Kentuck Campground Wood Shelter at the only road crossing in the middle of the trail, or (3) the Jonathan Run Trail at the northern terminus. These points also denote the distinct ""heads"" of the trail. 

The southern half of the trail is rolling with a few climbs and descent that can be enjoyed. The northern half is a single hill of 400 feet that is made of loose rock (2"" diameter). However, Jonathan Run Trail is a beautiful trail crossing over Jonathan Run several times, which is a 10-15 foot wide stream over little depth.

Note: when exiting the woods heading south to north, you'll exit the woods to a campground road with the wood shelter to your left. Stay on the road, heading up the small incline. The Kentuck Trail juts off the road and immediately begins the descent to Jonathan Trail.

2.8,Point to Point,1799,1561,307,132,3,18,Mill Run Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        For the most part Mill Run Trail is flat, on loamy soil, with few challenges. Nevertheless, it is a stunning stretch of singletrack notable for its beauty as it courses along Quebec/Mill Run. The trail runs along a camping area that provides an excellent place to eat and relax. 

Also, from Mill Run Trail you can access Miller Trail, Rankin Trail, Grist Mill Trail, Brocker Trail, and Tebolt Trail, so the options are many to extend your hike from here in creative ways. 

The trail has a couple of small stream crossings and several muddy sections all of which can usually be bypassed. Full disclosure, there are a few challenges as the trail briefly ascends the sidehill before dropping down again and then at its southern end it climbs steeply.

2.1,Point to Point,1351,1213,241,226,4,10,Pleasant Valley Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        This singletrack trail begins with a climb into the forest of Moraine State Park.   The trail is full of roots and small rocks in the opening section and several areas can be swampy if it has rained recently.  

After the opening wooded section you enter a field.  Those familiar with the park will recognize this as the sled riding hill.  This is a very difficult section to navigate as there are no blazes here at all to guide you.  If you look closely you can see where the path winds across the hillside.  If you can't, aim for the bird nesting boxes and keep them just to your right. 

Next, you'll come to a road.  You'll cross the road and continue along the trees away from the road, keeping the trees to your left.   At the crest of the hill, head straight across and you'll see where the path leads down into the trees again.   

This section of the trail offers a view of the lake through the trees during the winter and early spring months.  Further down, the trail you'll pass some cuts that open up the lake view.  

Another road crossing comes up when you get to the Bear Run boat launch area. Signs are present here to keep you on the path. Again, the section after you cross the road is usually muddy. 

After that, you'll come upon signs for the Hilltop Trail.   Stay straight on the path to continue on the Pleasant Valley Trail.  

After another quarter mile or so you'll begin to descend.  As you near the bottom, you'll reach a Y intersection.  The Y signifies the end of the Pleasant Valley Trail, but it connects with the Sunken Garden Trail at this point.   If you go right, you'll be on the Sunken Garden Trail - Long Loop and have a few more miles added to your journey.  Heading left will follow the Sunken Garden Trail back to your vehicle and an open restroom.   

*NOTE*  The Sunken Garden Trail is a loop trail with only one exit so either direction will have you arriving at the same point. 

Following the Sunken Garden Trail - Short Loop will take you past the Rangers Office at the beginning of the park and then down along the lake.  After yet another wet section, a bridge across a small stream takes you close to the lake before returning you to the parking lot just before the Pleasant Valley Trail.

The trails in Roaring Run Natural Area are ""raw"" in the sense that there is minimal maintenance for removing debris and the terrain takes on a similar persona. The trails are rough, full of softball-sized rock and small sticks and debris are plentiful across the trails.

Starting from the Route 31 trailhead parking lot, McKenna Trail starts at the southern end of the parking lot (furthest end from Route 31) following the treeline before entering the woods. Once in the woods, the trail winds its way over two smaller hills before encountering the first major intersection with Painter Rock Trail (note, there are two other trails that intersect McKenna, and they lead to Painter Rock Road trail). Trails are blazed and major intersections are marked with sign posts. To continue on McKenna, stay straight/right to climb the most significant rise on McKenna. At the top, hikers will begin to descend before hiking into North Loop Trail.

There is no mountain biking or horseback riding. Adding to the technical terrain and often steep climbs or descents, the trails are often empty giving hikers solitude, if that's the desire.

This nearly-flat maintained trail is wide enough for walking, running, and biking, offering great views of the Susquehanna River along the way. Keep an eye out for bald eagles, as they can be found on the river looking for a meal.

The full trail is just about 30 miles long, but for its duration it remains similar to the portion described above. The elevation change is slight, but there will be a gentle ascent if you take it as mapped. With many starting and stopping off points, you can make a variety of customized loops, or you can take on its full distance.

This makes for a good short hike from the lower parking lot and back using Trail #5 as the connector. On the more western side, this trail goes by a large hill that this trail circles, but there are a few bouldering opportunities here, if you're feeling like traveling vertically. It could also be considered a preview or practice for Trail #15. The trail has a few rock gardens, but they are much smaller and easier to navigate than what you'll find on Trail #15.

1.9,Point to Point,797,744,63,102,2,8,Nine Mile Run Trail,Easy,3.5,"        The main trailhead and parking area is located just off Braddock Avenue just before the on-ramp for the parkway in-bound.  The trail as a whole is smooth gravel, with a brief section over concrete.  

The trail starts out with a gentle downhill before leveling off for the remainder of the section prior to crossing Forward Ave.  This section follows closely to the Nine Mile Run, and is surrounded by forest and tall grasses, making it a heat and humidity collector in summer.

You'll come to a small parking lot at Forward Ave and will have to cross to continue.  You'll pass under the parkway, which is at the Squirrel Hill Tunnel for reference.

From here, the trail becomes more scenic, while remaining well groomed with a gravel base.  You'll be faced with slight climb and quarter mile of flat trail surrounded again by tall grasses.  Then comes the 'big dip' which drops down to Nine Mile Run and immediately back up, losing and gaining the same amount of elevation on either side.

The remainder of the trail takes you to Old Browns Hill Road, where if you head down the hill to the Monongahela River, you can access Duck Hollow Trail (a paved rail-trail).

4.6,Point to Point,295,147,579,547,5,28,White Trail,Intermediate,3.5,"        This trail starts from the Orange Trail just north of West Walnut Lane. The trail rolls along paralleling the Orange Trail the entire way. The first 0.1 mile is on the Orange Trail.  Keep an eye out as you hike, as there are many access trails, trail crossings and even road crossings as you head north along the White Trail. There is a very steep hill (though it is short) about 1.8 miles along the trail (if you're heading north). 

At the junction with the Orange Trail about 2.6 miles in, the trail begins to climb to the higher elevations in this valley. Wissahickon Creek will be visible for the majority of the trail when the trees are not leafed out (late fall through early spring). Unlike the Orange Trail which is a singletrack trail, White Trail is wide enough to hike two abreast for the vast majority of its length. A special feature is the Statue of Tedyuscung at mile 4.1. The trail ends at another junction with the Orange Trail and the Laveder Trail. I highly recommend adding the Lavender Trail to your hike as it follows a babbling brook back down to the Orange Trail which is a delightful highlight.

Back in the day, it was used by mule teams pulling boats along the canal. Today this route is used by hikers, runners, cyclists, and bird watchers. 

The route is not technically challenging and gains less than 150 feet of elevation over its entire distance. It has several access points and crosses some diverse and varied terrain. Hikers will enjoy a variety of scenery no matter what portion of the trail they decide to hike. 

For more information about the trail, visit the park's website.

8.2,Point to Point,930,895,92,96,0,2,Shenango River Trail,Intermediate,3.5,"        This is a nice and enjoyable trail when the brush is clear, but more often than not it isn't. Every so often a group clears it aggressively, but the brush regrows just as aggressively.

Start at either end, Kidd's Mill or Big Bend. It's generally easy to hike and follow at the start, but sooner or later the thick brush takes over. There are sections that are very wet, depending on how the rain has been, and there are many obstacles and large fallen logs to climb over. It is easy to get lost, but the important thing to remember is that it was once a towpath. So the trail will ideally hike along the manmade ridge next to the canal pools, much like the raised railroad bed of a rail trail.

From New Hamburg, the southern section is generally much more clear.

Mostly level river trail with a few dips for stream crossings. No engineered features, but many natural obstacles such as roots, mud, and loose sections. One old pipe crosses the trail at shallow angles.

Stream crossings are frequent and vary greatly in difficulty. In some cases, the mud is surprisingly deep and can lead to some difficulty navigating through. Make sure your shoes/boots are tied tightly!

The trail splits frequently for horses one direction and foot traffic the other. Follow the horse direction to ford a stream, or the hike direction to cross a narrow bridge with railing.

From Harmonyville Road, you'll pass through farmland until you reach the woods, where you'll be surrounded by oak, hickory, tuliptree, beech, maple, and spicebush trees. Nearly extinct American chestnuts sprout from decaying stumps. The trail passes over Northside Road twice along it's loop.

The trail is easily located at the eastern terminus where signposts signal the trail split. Slightly harder to identify at the western terminus, the trail spurs off from the GRT/NCT without any significant signage.  Possibly the easiest way to remember that the trail splits is by using Lake Arthur as the marker. Nowhere else on the GRT/NCT does the trail get so close to Lake Arthur. So, keep this in mind. You'll descend what will seem like the 4th or 5th significant hill, and arrive at Lake Arthur, but the trail will turn and head up a hill within 2 minutes (.1 mile) after reaching the lake. This is where the trail splits, and if you stay along the banks of Lake Arthur, you'll have linked into this alternate route.

This alternate is really nice, providing a change of pace and scenery for the first half of the trail. Finally out of the woods, you'll have the lake and fisherman dotting the banks. However, you'll eventually turn north and climb over 1 mile to the top of the hill before linking back into the GRT/NCT trail.

The trail is best east to west and seems to get slightly easier in that direction as well. The beginning is a jumble of rocks that you'll have to navigate. 

The trail intersects with several trails that traverse between Hunter Rd and Henstep Valley Trail, so there are always options to shorten your hike. The intersections themselves aren't always marked, but its pretty clear that you want to stay on the ridge and keep following the trail on the spine itself. 

There are a few rock outcroppings along the trail to keep it interesting. At the end, the trail drops off a little steeply, so watch your footing.

16.2,Point to Point,1527,1173,1728,1761,4,19,North Country Trail: Moraine State Park (Glacier Ridge Trail),Intermediate/Difficult,3.2,"        Trail access is located at the parking lot for the bike shop. This section of the NCT follows the Glacier Ridge Trail, and shares the bright blue blazes. In general, the trail is well-groomed, but there are sections of loose rock and larger rocks that slow your pace. 

Heading north/east, the trail starts by taking you over Hidden River Bridge before crossing the bike path and N. Shore Drive. Once over the road, you start the first of many climbs. Continue following the blazes over several roads, around one small pond, and past the marina on your way to the end of this section at Route 528, near the bridge crossing over Lake Arthur. 

Once you cross Route 528, you'll be presented with a 300-foot climb to the top of a ridge, which offers a nice view of Lake Arthur in fall and winter when the leaves have dropped. There are several stretches of open space as you climb which also give glimpses of the lake. The next 5 miles are similar to the first 8. You'll make 3 climbs along singletrack trail which is primarily smooth with occasional sections of loose rock. You'll recognize the end of the trail when you reach the Jennings Environmental Center and a uphill slope of flower beds. The NCT continues on to Allegheny National Forest, and all the way to the New England states, but Jennings Environmental Center marks the end of the Glacier Ridge Trail.

Note, if you head south from the bike shop parking lot, the trail continues for approximately a mile before dumping hikers out at the intersection of Burnside Road and W. Park Road. The NCT continues to McConnell's Mill State Park using Burnside Road and Johnson Road. In McConnell's Mill the NCT follows the Slippery Rock Gorge Trail.

2.2,Point to Point,1529,935,594,508,9,29,Bower Fields Trails,Difficult,3.0,"        Turn off of Raccoon Mountain Trail at the Yellow Diamond markers. This trail is marked for CCW as the main direction.  Either way you decide to take this loop, you'll have a tough climb followed by a wide open downhill. 

After a nice spillway you'll hit a set of old foundations; take a deep breath and sip of water because at the next marked intersection, the climbing begins. Right is the Upper Bower Field Trail and left is Lower (less elevation and much shorter). Take the right and push yourself up to the metal gate which you'll currently have to go around and then continue to the top.  

There is a marked singletrack connector at the top before heading back down. Unfortunately, there is another gate to make your way around before the descent. The descent is marked with directional arrows where needed.  After the foundations, you'll find the intersection with Lower Bower where you'll want to take a right along the stone walls. You'll end up on the common connector and return to Raccoon Mountain Trail..

If you choose the Lower Bower Connector during the climb, you'll have a much shorter climb. Follow this CCW just as the Upper's description and enjoy.  Lower Bower Connector actually connects both sets of really cool building foundations.

It's a nice intermediate trail through some really tall pines and mixed forest. With barely a rock or root, this will be a great place for a beginner to get some experience hiking singletrack.

Using this trail in either direction is fine. The opening from Mohn Mill has a gate to go around, and the opening from Gap Road is next to the telephone pole. The trail entrance on that side isn't very wide in an effort to reduce hoof or quad traffic. This trail is blazed in red.

Please do not take the border trail that is marked in white and orange. That is not part of our trail. Basically, if you hike north, take two rights, and you'll be fine.

Go through the gate and just keep hiking! You'll cross a wooden bridge before arriving at an intersection. Go to the left to follow the Musser Gap Trail. If you go right, you'll hike the Frog Hollow Trail instead. This part of the trail is a bit inclined but doable. You'll arrive at another intersection (the second intersection); take it left again. If you go straight, you'll be hiking the Mountain Mist Trail. 

After a little while, you'll arrive at another intersection. Here, this trail is crossed perpendicularly by the Mountain Mist Trail. Keep hiking straight if you want to follow the Musser Gap Trail.

If you decide to go back, you could go to your right (following the Mountain Mist Trail). This path will take you to the second intersection that you encountered before, forming a mini-loop. CAREFUL HERE! Following the Mountain Mist Trail requires you to turn right at some point (it's marked but you might not see the entrance). You'll know that you have missed the turn to the Mountain Mist Trail if you see the signal that says ""No hunting, trapping, hiking is permitted before this point"".

Accessing the trail from Squaw Valley Park, take the Squaw Valley Footpath until you reach the open stretch of field behind the children's play area. Hike toward Fox Chapel Road, and the singletrack will be on your right, and is obvious.

The trail winds along dirt and grass sections. Because the trail is lightly traveled, the grass sections may not be as obvious, but there is little room to move as you are often between the road and Squaw Run in those grass sections.

You'll cross a ""wood"" arched bridge right before the end of the trail. From the bridge, you'll hike along grass first on the right side of the road, and then left side, crossing at the intersection. The trail ends at the following intersection.

Just before you reach Sullivan Road at the end of the Commissary Trail, look left for an unnatural looking berm rising up.  (It will be between a small footpath and a larger footpath with yellow posts).  

Ascend the berm and you'll find yourself along the top of a wall built to impound water pumped from the Schuylkill River. The berm was created as part of the first large scale river cleanup effort in the United States.  In the Late 1940's and early 1950's, Pennsylvania and the Army Corps of Engineers dredged and cleaned the Schuylkill River in an effort to remove large amounts of polluting coal silt.  This wall is part of Impounding Basin #21, built to contain the large amounts of coal laden water that were removed from the Schuylkill River.  Inside the basin is a large stone weir which allowed silt to settle and water to return to the river.

Atop the basin is a small footpath.  Aside from a slight grade at the entry point the remainder of the trail is level.  There is a lot of understory growth including thorns to navigate along the way.  The remnants of this berm end at the Commissary Trail

From the parking area at the River Trail, follow the River Trail briefly and look for a trail to the left.  Follow this path to the left until it connects to a gravel road, which will be marked with 2 yellow bollards. Turn right on the gravel road.  Next up on your right is the entrance to a trail on top of the impoundment. This is part of the Walnut Hill Desilting Basin trail.  Ignore it for now and continue on the gravel road.

Continue through the gate and follow the road to the left.  As you clear the treeline to your right, there will be a trailhead sign on the right and parking on the left.  You may wish to just park here and skip the gravel road section of the trail.  The trail goes east into the field. A well worn path is obvious.  It will turn right into the trees on the far side of the berm forming the impounding basin.  From here, the path remains obvious but not as well maintained.  Be aware of washout and mud.  The trail will cross a bridge before turning right and reconnecting with the River Trail, which makes for a very pleasant loop. 

An optional extension of this trail follows the power line cut until another connector allows you to turn right to the River Trail or left to the Schuylkill River Trail - Pawlings to Betzwood.

3.7,Point to Point,2429,1628,802,184,5,17,Tebolt Trail,Difficult,3.0,"        The Tebolt Trail is mostly rough doubletrack. Usually used to finish the Clockwise Quebec loop, it is an ascent from Mill/Quebec Run up to the junction leading to the parking area. The climb is a consistent and there are a few tougher sections but nothing unmanageable. It is also worth noting that there is a stream crossing near the beginning that can be challenging when the water is high.

Tebolt Trail Intersects the Hess Trail near the trailhead parking area. If your hike starts at the parking area, you'll descend the steep section of the Hess Trail, which can be a wake up call because it is moderately steep and rough due to an abundance of small rocks. The junction is reached very quickly. However, it's more likely that you'll end your hike with the Tebolt Trail.

At the fork in the trail, take the left onto what looks like a tall grass path (right takes you onto Hunters Ridge Trail). The path rises up a small slope leaving behind the grass.

The trail winds its way around the hillside, providing mostly manageable trail with a few instances of tall grasses obstructing view of foot placement. Hikers will pass by a ""trail"" of sorts at a distinctive intersection. There are two options; straight takes you to the connector trail, and right keeps hikers on Adams Run Trail. Adams Run Trail begins its descent to the game land dirt road. To connect back with the campground, make a left on the dirt road and look for the Lowlands Trail sign on the right.

Note: The connector trail is a grass hillside with yellow blazes, but no trail visible. Moreover, the hillside is a water runoff, making it sloppy and not very easy to hike.

3.0,Point to Point,1802,1437,377,493,6,11,Old Green Ridge Road,Intermediate,3.0,"        This easy-to-follow trail begins as an old doubletrack logging road. After approximately one mile, it passes through a clearing that has been dubbed a wild turkey habitat project before re-entering the forest in a singletrack fashion. Shortly, the trail begins to climb, reaching gradients in the 8-12% range for three quarters of a mile until it tops out in a clear-cut/nuke zone that is particularly unattractive. 

The last stretch is on a gravel road to the terminus at Rattlesnake Run Road. I took it in January and the winter views were nice, if unspectacular.

Starting from Bear Meadows Loop heading south, hikers will go up a moderate incline to an intersection with section 8 of the Mid State Trail. About 25 yards after the intersection is a smaller campsite with a fire ring on a charcoal flat.  

The descent down to Wampler Road is generally pretty thick with Mountain Laurel.

Miller Road, that extends from Laurel Summit Road to the intersection with Silvermine but is gated just beyond. Beyond the gate the trail is a more distinctly doubletrack with grass down the middle.  

Part way between the gate and Bobcat Trail is a link connecting this trail to the Wolf Rocks Trail, which would allow you to hike the easier middle section of Wolf Rocks Trail in combination with Spruce Flats Trail rather than the road. If Wolf Rocks Trail is your sole destination, there is a parking area adjacent to the beginning intersection.  If you are using this trail to access the south segment of Black Bear Trail, the intersection there is indistinct.

After a challenging uphill rocky section, the trail turns into singletrack again before a right turn leads up a steep gravel road climb. There will be an intersection on a left turn that is not apparent on the map. Heading to the right will continue to Rock-n-Ridge #4 and left will come out at the Group Camp.

After crossing Caledonia Pike, the trail skirts around the Shaggers Inn Shallow Water Impoundment. 

Take a short detour down the road to check out the small lake.  After crossing Shaggers Inn Rd., the trail follows an old logging road before turning back into singletrack leading to a nice overlook before heading down a steep mountain.  The trail ends at the base of the mountain on Little Medix Rd. where it rejoins the orange-blazed Quehanna Trail.  

The West Cross Connector can be used to create a 19 mile Western loop of the Quehanna Trail for a nice overnight backpacking trip or long day hike. It can also be used to create an Eastern loop of the Quehanna Trail, which would cut off approximately 12 miles worth of hiking.

3.9,Point to Point,791,719,125,184,1,9,Lake Shore Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        The Lake Shore Trail is considered the most scenic trail in Little Pine State Park, running along the lake into the upper valley of the park.

Using the Little Pine Creek dam as its starting point, the route heads out across to the other side and then turns left. Here, it enters a wooded area along the lakeshore. There's a bit of a climb followed by a descent, taking you to the nesting area of a pair of bald eagles.

Keeping your eyes peeled, continue on to a beautiful valley beyond the lake. You'll arrive at the loop section of the hike here. Either way, there's a climb and descent. As you make your way around, you'll be in a mix of open areas and wooded forest.

Once you've completed the loop, head back toward the dam on rolling terrain that climbs back to the beginning of the hike.

Miller Road) and extends northward to a point where it dumps out on Laurel Summit Road. The northern section of Black Bear, signed as Expert branches off to the left just before reaching the road. The easiest north-south connection requires bypassing Black Bear Trail North and using approximately 0.4 mile of Laurel Summit Road (open) to Locust Camp Road (gated).

The central section consists of level singletrack with a few rounded embedded boulders. A light rocky section is located near the intersection with Hemlock Trail and the Black Bear Trail West.

From the west, the trail starts at the Audubon Hawk Watch parking lot.  A short side trail leads from the TT up talus slopes to overlook with good views south across the Cumberland Valley.  

Past the Hawk Watch, the trail enters the F.J. Reineman Wildlife sanctuary and proceeds east along the northern bench of the mountain.  This section of trail is particularly rocky.

The trail eventually comes to a junction with old Longs Gap Road and bears north onto in and descends (to the south, the road leads a short distance to good views of Cumberland Valley).  Near the base of the mountain, the TT bears east off-road and ascends back to the northern bench of the mountain.

Just before bearing north and descending along the power line cut, the trail passes a talus slope with good views to the south.  At the base of the mountain, the trail bears east of the power line cut onto dirt road near a cabin and proceeds to PA-34 (Spring Road).  The trail then bears south on a road and ascends along the shoulder to Sterretts Gap.

2.5,Point to Point,724,597,156,164,2,6,Slateford Loop Trail,Intermediate,2.8,"        Roam along the Slateford Loop Trail ready to experience beautiful farmlands and dense, colorful Pennsylvanian hardwood forests.

Starting at the Arrow Island Trail South Parking Area off National Park Dr., travel north along the Arrow Island Spur and turn left at the junction with the Arrow Island Trail. Follow the Arrow Island trail (heading west) for a short while until it reaches a T intersection with the Slateford Loop Trail. 

At this point, visitors can hike whichever direction they choose, taking note that this trail is a series of two loops joined by a central connector. Those wishing for a shorter excursion can remain on the eastern loop, while those wishing for more time in the woods can hike both loops. 

While on trail, keep your eyes peeled for the remains of a bygone slate quarry and a historic farm which both exist today as weathered, brown structures. The trail is somewhat rolling, but not overly strenuous.

If you're taking the larger of the two loops, note that you may have to navigate a small portion of the southern extent on a little-used portion of National Park Drive.

The trail is a mix of narrow singletrack and some sections of doubletrack that starts with a steep climb from the west before it levels out through the forest and clear cuts higher up. Part way through the trail, hikers will encounter an area of loose ""doll head"" rocks that make for slightly awkward footing.

Visitors to the trail have the option to park at either the southern parking area off National Park Drive, or the northern parking area off Route 611 near the Arrow Island Overlook.

Starting at the southern parking area, follow the short Arrow Island Spur to a junction with the Arrow Island Trail. Continue right along the trail, keeping your eyes peeled for remnants of the vibrant cultural history embedded in the forests along the Delaware. 

Back in the beginning of the 20th century, numerous hotels and tourist attractions were located along this stretch of river. 

If you're lucky, you just might see the remains of two different periods of occupation along the trail: first a series of old farm fences, and second a collection of stone supports that once upheld a raucous casino. 

Lastly, bring your eyes up to the towering cliffs above the trail for an exciting peek into prime peregrine falcon territory. For those with access to a pair of binoculars, this trail presents the perfect opportunity to use them! 

Upon reaching the trail's end, hop across the road to the Arrow Island Overlook for stunning views of the Delaware River and Arrow Island.

20.7,Point to Point,296,79,687,531,1,5,Perkiomen Trail,Easy/Intermediate,2.7,"        This 20-mile trail follows the Perkiomen Creek from Oaks (at the Schuylkill Tr to Green Lane Park).  The trail is mostly crushed stone with a few paved paths.  The majority of the trail is wide enough for several people to hike alongside each other.  

The trail begins at  the Schuylkill Tr in Oaks. but there is no parking at this point.  There is a parking lot for Lower Perkiomen Valley Park on Mill Rd,(on trail, but 1 mile from S end). Entire section from parking South to the Schuylkill Tr is paved.  In this section, there are picnic tables, fire pits, and pavilions.  There are athletic fields used for organized soccer and ultimate events.  This section is wooded with cut grass undercover.

To the North, the trail and creek cross under Egypt Road Bridge and follow the Perkiomen upstream.  For approx 1 mile, the trail remains a wide paved surface.  When this large surface reaches Upper Indian Head Rd (the first road encountered, and blocked with yellow bollards), the trail turns left/away from the creek.  It will follow road briefly until a gravel path on the right approximately midway up first rise.  Go right as the path dives through some wooded areas.  This next section will be a mix of crushed gravel path and hard pack dirt/rock path.

There will be two hazardous road crossings.  Each crossing carries the trail at an angle across the road somewhat in a hill section of the road with limited sight distance for drivers.  Although the crossings are well marked, traffic generally moves quickly and drivers may not heed the trail signs.

After these two crossings, there are few hazards.  The remaining road crossings are either protected with signals or have plenty of visibility for trail users and drivers. The trail passes through Collegeville in the form of sidewalks and paths between buildings.It passes close to a brewery, a diner, and several other dining options.  North of Collegeville, a large portion of the trail is paved until it reaches Central Perkiomen Valley Park, another picnic and recreation facility with parking bathroom facilities.   The Skippack Trail offers a side trip to the Village of Skippack.

To North, trail is mostly crushed gravel with some pavement. It passes old Mill House, Pennypacker Mills Historic Site, and Green Lane Park, offering swimming, boating, and camping facilities.  Visit  montcopa.org/index.aspx?nid… for camping, boating, fishing and more trails in Green Lane Park

3.0,Point to Point,1293,978,270,325,4,11,Bridle Trail (Red Blaze),Intermediate,2.5,"        This trail can start at either the spillway to the east or at the entrance to the lodge at the north end. You immediately begin by climbing (from either direction) before the trail plateaus into a rolling, mile long, upper stretch. Typically muddy with ""streams"" running down the trail at the ascents/descents, this trail can be an interesting adventure.

Also, it's a great addition to the Red/Blue Blaze, which creates a loop around the lodge.  However, it is not an easy 9'ish mile loop, with lots of ups and downs, doubling back, and little flat terrain.

If the technical sections don't wear you out, the climbs will. Once you hit the powerline, follow that down the fire road all the way to right before the end where it goes up a little bit and comes out onto Sulphur Springs Rd.

When utilized from west to east, it is a fireroad climb to the powerline and then a rocky technical downhill to Shaffers Trail.

4.4,Point to Point,749,637,134,104,1,6,Lakeside Trail,Difficult,2.5,"        Start at the Bald Eagle Launch in Howard. The trail goes through a heavily wooded area with lots of  creek crossings and rock gardens. It remains within 20 ft or so of the lake shore on the way out (but views of the lake are limited by the heavy growth). The trail is a flattened lollipop shape. 

The second half is a loop that follows the lake edge on the way out, crosses under the train tracks and continues through the woods, paralleling the train tracks back to Park Rd. Follow Park Rd for a few hundred yards to get to the crossover back under the train tracks to connect with the first part of the trail. Retrace your steps on the first half of Lakeview Trail to return to the parking lot.

42.7,Point to Point,1180,722,1124,1030,1,7,Montour Trail,Easy,2.3,"        This rail trail technically connects Coraopolis with the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP) in McKeesport; although, a section is under development around Jefferson Hills.  

The trail itself is a mix of cinder and paved path. It gently climbs the first 10 miles to the foot of Robinson Town Center. From here's the trail dips and dives, never at more than a 1% grade, through the South Hills. 

The trail offers access to Panhandle Trail, which brushes by Settlers Cabin State Park, and the trails at South Park (South Park Connection to Montour Trail).  

For access to GAP trail:
Unfortunately, the trail is incomplete past South Park. To continue to McKeesport, hikers will need to follow Piney Fork Road making a right at the current southern/eastern trail terminus. This will take hikers through a narrow tunnel before a 4-way intersection where the rail trail picks up again on the road's edge. After a quarter mile, hikers will cross Gill Hall Road, ending the roadside rail section, and follow Peters Creek Road for roughly 3 miles. After crossing route 51 and staying on Peters Creek Road, hikers will find the Montour Trail East section dipping into Clairton. 

In Clairton, make a right on North State Street and cross Clairton-Glassport bridge. Follow Ohio Avenue north making your way through Glassport and eventually over the 5th Ave bridge into McKeesport. Most of this section is over bike shared roads with sidewalks available. The full length of Montour Trail to McKeesport is around 60 miles.

1.5,Point to Point,147,104,76,71,2,7,Upper Schuylkill River Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        NOTE:  This portion of trail is not associated with the longer-distance Schuylkill River Trail and not part of that system. This may become an alternate path for the longer trail, but the official Schuylkill River Trail is located on the Chester County or western side of the river.  Instead, this trail is part of the proposed ""Schuylkill East Trail"" which would be a similar long distance trail. Though this section is complete, the longer trail is still in progress (or possibly just in planning).

This trail follows the Schuylkill River on the Montgomery County side of the river. From the parking area at Lock 60 Park, cross the small footbridge over the canal and turn left. Go past the gate and follow a small footpath upriver.  

In the beginning, this will be a grassy path. Along your left there will be the remnants of moorings for the canal and an older generating station. At the upriver end of the canal is Black Rock Dam, which is about 1/3 mile into the route. 

Depending on river levels, it may be difficult to proceed beyond the dam. Normally, the far right edge of the dam is exposed and passable. From here, the trail becomes more gravel/rock bed and narrower with a few spots of mud and small water crossings. At the upriver end of the trail, you'll come to Upper Schuylkill Valley Park and Wildlife Center operated by Montgomery County. There is also a picnic and parking area here.

From the parking lot, head back on Mill Rd towards Egypt Road. The trail crosses over the Perkiomen Trail and Perkiomen Creek on the Egypt Rd Bridge. After crossing the bridge, look for bollards denoting where the path passes through a wooden fence. 

The trail passes through a meadow offering opportunities for birding and wildflower observation before crossing the Mine Run (bridge). Here, the trail enters a wooded area and begins a steep ascent. A few marked side trails are off to the right following Mine Run into the Perkiomen. As the trail levels out, the remains of an old copper and lead mine will be on your left, (with an interpretive sign). The paved trail continues on and reaches the edge of a large field. As the trail turns a corner, a large bird blind is positioned facing the field. 

If you wish to visit the Museum (Audubon's house) and Raptor Center (next to the house), follow the dirt path across the field and turn to the right. You can return to the loop trail by following the driveway until it crosses the trail just before exiting the property at the corner of Audubon Road and Pawlings Road. 

The paved loop trail continues around the edge of the field and turns to follow Pawlings Road. The trail runs alongside Pawlings Road for a bit. On the non-road side of the trail look for more birds and forest restoration activities (and more interpretive waysides). There will be one short descent and climb when the trail crosses Old Mill Road. The trail continues on to cross US 422 via the Pawlings Rd Bridge (concrete barriers isolate the trail and vehicular traffic, fencing prevents leaping from the bridge). 

The trail joins the Schuylkill River Trail - Conshohocken to Parkersford at the Pawlings Road Trail Parking area.

From here, the trail descends all the way to the end, where it once again connects with the Koto Buki Trail, at the edge of the woods. Along the way, you'll follow the fence line of the police academy.  

Also, many singletrack spurs shoot off of the trail and can be taken to extend the loop or exit the woods on Ingomar Road before the end of the trail.

A sign off Reservoir Drive marks the start of the trail, which passes above the Pittsburgh Zoo. In summer, you can hear the howling monkeys near the end of the trail, which is also the only ""climb"" along the trail.

The end of the trail dumps you onto what appears to be an old road way, now covered over by grass.

1.2,Point to Point,1233,999,8,234,4,10,Koto Buki Trail (Purple/Black Dot Blaze),Intermediate,2.0,"        This trail has several road crossings along Ridge Road, but a lesser used road and within the park limits, making them safer as people tend to drive a bit slower (fingers crossed).

This trail connects the pool and golf course, opening the door for the Golf Course Trail (Orange Blaze) and Parish Hill Loop (Green Blaze).

    ",PA
0.4,Loop,1591,1576,14,15,2,5,Gobbler's Knob,Easy,2.0,"        This is a very easy and short loop that is on the grounds of Gobbler's Knob where the Groundhog's Day ceremony is held every year.  It begins and ends next to the visitor center/museum.  It is a flat and wide trail that leads through a wooded area and is lined by informational displays, metal art installations, and picnic tables.  Once it curves around, the stage area is on the left.  It then continues back through the parking lot to the trailhead.
    ",PA
1.7,Point to Point,205,157,86,126,2,10,Horse Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        Starting at the parking area, follow the trail to Thompson Rd and turn right.  Walk down this road until you get to the turn to Lesher.  If you want to cut the hike short, you can follow Lesher to the end of this trail.

At the turn, head straight down the trail that seems to go straight when the road turns left.  This will take you down to the Skippack Creek.  While the trail might be poorly marked, if you follow the creek you'll eventually end up at an area to turn left.  If you miss this, you'll get to the bridge.  If you cross the bridge you'll get onto the Skippack Loop Trail.

Heading left, you'll go uphill to Lesher Rd. to the point where it becomes abandoned.  From here I would turn around if just doing this trail, or head down to the end of Lesher to cross the road.

If you are feeling brave, head left to the end of this trail.  There is a very deep stream crossing in which you'll either get completely soaked or get stabbed by thorns finding a way around.

1.4,Point to Point,199,109,116,46,2,11,Unnamed Horse Trail,Easy,2.0,"        This trail does not have a name.  To the West of PA Turnpike, this trail is outside of Valley Forge Park and is a paved single path.  The transition area under the Turnpike bridge is poorly maintained, muddy, and highly eroded.  To the East of the turnpike bridge (NPS Boundary), the trail is approximately 1 vehicle width mowed path through grassy fields. The trail follows Valley Creek across from Lafayette's Quarters.  

Just south of the Knox Farm, the trail crosses Valley Creek.  This crossing is designed for horses, at low water it is passable by bike, and when flow is low enough, it could probably be done on foot (although there is a foot bridge just a little farther ahead on Knox Trail).  Once on the East side of Valley Creek, the trail backtracks a little upstream to an abandoned forge before turning East across a field heading towards the ""Airplane Field"" (AKA ""Archery Field"").  This field hosts a model radio controlled airplane club.  In 1969, Valley Forge park hosted the first World Archery Championships held outside of Europe.  Perhaps this explains the ""Archery Field"" name.

0.7,Point to Point,1671,1323,350,2,9,27,Power Line Trail,Difficult,2.0,"        This hike starts off of a paved campsite road and follows the gravel access road along the power lines. The trail is relatively flat in the beginning, and requires a small stream crossing. 

Towards the end, the rocks uphill are large and loose. At the top, there is a view. A connection to the Plantation Trail and Fireline Trail is accessible via this trail.

It starts by the Pool, park at the ballfield, and uses a very brief section of the Rachel Carson Trail to lead you into the woods. It wraps around the pool, over Babcock Blvd (be careful) and finally passes over the ALL Purple Blaze before leading to the Purple/Black Dot Blaze, or the Koto Buki Trail. Either purple blazed trail will lead you to the same place.

The trail takes a right shortly after it starts and stays on top of the hill. If you go straight, on the wide path, you'll be on the Ho-Ya-Neh Trail. 

You'll start down a wide logging-like road made of dirt and something like natural oversized gravel, and it's all downhill. It can get steep in spots and may have some ruts.

Begin climbing a ridgeline while crossing through the industrial park where orange blazes begin. Watch carefully for blazes around Blue Triangle Hardwoods' active log loading yard. Continue on past a dirt Game Land parking area (drivers have to go through the log yard!) and climb more steeply, eventually passing through the Scully Squeeze rock formation. 

From there, continue on upwards, and make your way over large boulders. Meet the MST proper on the top of the ridge. The Blue Triangle-Scully Squeeze portion of the trail will become the main trail once the route is open to Everett's Tenley Path - see  hike-mst.org/index.php/guid… for updates.

While this route isn't the most scenic portion of the trail, it is the preferred way to make your way through urban Everett.

1.1,Loop,1249,1108,137,145,5,12,Orange Loop,Intermediate,2.0,"        The trail is accessed from the Hartwood Acres Purple Loop near the mansion parking lot.  Starting south you'll follow the purple loop for a few hundred feet before jumping across the road/walking path and continuing the Orange Loop.

The trail is smooth with a dip into a valley and a climb back out but not terribly challenging.  You'll poke out of the woods for a brief period, and on a hot summer day it feels like jumping into and then out of a furnace.

The trail runs steadily downhill for nearly two thirds of its length before running head on into Bog Run. This is a tricky spot, as the natural flow of the trail would have hikers continue straight; however, to continue on Beaver Dam Path, take the hard right. This final third of trail is steep and runs within a washout full of 1' diameter boulders. The trail ends at Trout Run.

While the red loop circumnavigates the hill, the green loop takes you to the top and back down in just a mile of trail.  The trail is typical to Western PA.  It has some roots, mainly dirt, and after a rainfall can become slightly slick and hard to scramble in one area in particular.

1.0,Point to Point,2790,2696,96,11,2,4,Loop Trail,Easy,2.0,"        This trail begins as a gentle singletrack, which can be muddy at times, just north of the warming hut at a signed entrance. The middle section shares its doubletrack alignment, and the single small hill, with Interstate Trail.  Shortly beyond the top of the hill, it branches off to the left on a wide singletrack that crosses Bill Albert's Trail and connects to Lippo's Loop Trail. This section is smooth graded for groomed cross country skiing, but is a good introduction to hiking in the woods.

The warming hut is open 24/7 to provide shelter from inclement weather, including a wood burning stove for heat.  Pit toilets are adjacent.  No overnight camping.

There is a three car pull off on South Elk Run Rd, about 100 yards north of Arnot Road.

1.0,Point to Point,1194,1009,136,185,6,17,Buckskin Trail,Easy/Intermediate,1.5,"        Access to this trail can be found at the intersection of Nichol Road and Pioneer Camp Road or off Pinto Loop Trail.  

From Nichol Road, the trail heads downhill and is cut into the slope. Wide enough for horses to traverse, the trail can become soggy and is pitted with horse tracks.

You'll pass Camp Trail on the left before coming to a Y in the trail. Take the right, heading uphill at a pair of wood log steps. The left connects with Heritage Trail.

Parking is available at the park n' Ride lot immediately before the trailhead on Peters Creek Road. The trail runs along Peters Creek Road before the road ends and the trail enters denser woods and winds along the creek at the base of a hill.  

When in Clairton, hikers can access McKeesport and the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP) trail following roadways. See Montour Trail for more details.

0.7,Loop,776,762,13,14,1,1,Squaw Valley Footpath,Easy,1.0,"        This path encompasses Squaw Valley Park, and acts as an entry point to the Salamander Trail and Old Squaw Trail. The trail is a cinder path used by walkers, those with dogs, and runners.
    ",PA
1.1,Point to Point,1188,1127,85,62,3,7,Palomino Trail,Intermediate,1.0,"        Access to this trail is from Nichol Road, at either end, or from Forest Trail midway.

The trail is doubletrack, shared with horseback riding, making it rutted in muddy sections. The final turn at the northern end is a sharp left onto a singletrack section before coming back to Nichol Road.
    ",PA
0.4,Point to Point,1148,1128,17,28,2,3,Black Cherry Trail,Easy,1.0,"        The trail is located just off the upper parking lot. Hiking south, the trail bridges the parking lot with the Muddy Run Trail, and eventually the longer Chestnut Path and Bog Run trails.

In the beginning, the trail dips to a small pond with wooden deck and benches. The trail is smooth with no real obstacles. It T's into Muddy Run. A right at the intersection goes back to the main road, and left heads towards Chestnut Path and the base of the hill at Cabin Hollow.
    ",PA
0.7,Point to Point,1131,1022,109,0,3,5,Orange/Green Blaze,Easy,1.0,"        Used primarily as a connector between the Orange Loop and Koto Buki Trail (Purple/Black Dot Blaze), the trail that parallels Kummer Road. The trail travels at a steady slope, and typically throughout the year has pockets of ground water that can get sloppy at times.
    ",PA
0.7,Point to Point,1283,1212,31,74,3,7,Appaloosa Spur Trail,Easy,1.0,"        This trail is mainly used as a way to connect a parking lot on the outskirts of Raccoon Creek State Park and the main Appaloosa Trail. The trail is heavily traveled by horseback; therefore, this trail does have heavy rutting from horses. While this route is an option for adding some mileage to your route, there are many more enjoyable trails within the park.
    ",PA
0.5,Point to Point,1093,928,0,165,6,12,Cabin Hollow Trail,Intermediate,1.0,"        The trail can be accessed from the southern terminus of Waterthrush Way or from Fern Hollow Road at the park maintenance building; the trail starts at the building road entrance.  

The trail is rugged with plenty of river rock and several very short, but steepish climbs. Hikers will cross over several seasonal streams with river rock beds.
    ",PA
0.6,Point to Point,1163,1143,13,33,2,4,Bridle Path,Intermediate,1.0,"        The trail starts roughly from the upper parking lot. At the far end of the lot is a fire road to the end of the park property.  Take a right at the end of the road to head back toward the park. Note, just before the end of the road is an intersection with the Gravel Path on the left, and an unmarked trail leading to the Butterfly Fields.

The Bridle Path is a tricky trail starting with a descent before a short climb and the final short descent to Waterthrush Way.  While considered separate trails, they are alike in trail surface, which is a mishmash of old concrete and loose stone.  Moreover, soil and vegetation has begun to grow in areas. This has left both trails in an odd situation where hikers will have to deal with uneven and constantly changing surfaces.  

The Bridle Path technically ends at a fork with Waterthrush Way to the left and the Laurel Trail to the right, which loops back to the Bridle Path.
    ",PA
0.1,Point to Point,1169,1138,30,0,4,9,Goldenrod Trail,Easy,1.0,"        This trail is a grass doubletrack that starts from the pond pavilion and runs south to Upper Fields Trail.
    ",PA
0.2,Point to Point,1137,1099,0,38,4,9,Waterthrush Way,Intermediate,1.0,"        What makes this trail slightly challenging is the trail surface, a mishmash of old concrete, loose stone, dirt and grass.

0.3,Point to Point,1099,1015,0,84,5,15,Cabin Trail,Intermediate,1.0,"        The trail bridges Cabin Hollow Trail and Waterfall Trail. From the start, the trail descends the hillside quickly before leveling out to a slight downhill grade. The trail does provide some vantage points of the hollow floor as you descend.
    ",PA
0.3,Point to Point,1140,1126,10,16,2,3,Laurel Trail,Easy,1.0,"        The trail is a semi-loop, running along the hillside. The trail is accessed from the Bridle Path at either end, and also connects with the Waterfall Trail. The view of the valley floor is mostly hidden, but some thinner areas of underbrush allow for a brief view down the hillside.

There are not many rocks on the trail, although there are plenty of roots to make up for it.
