The short hike leads to a gorgeous low angle natural arch that frames the valley below it beautifully. If possible, try to catch the view for sunrise when the light catches the red rocks wonderfully. It's a good spot because you can take good photos almost any time of day. Most every morning there are many people waiting for the sun to rise to get an iconic shot. I went in the afternoon and still had a good time. There are almost always people here so this is not the place to come for solitude. It's cool and worth seeing but not as cool as other areas in the park. The trail makes a very easy loop with stairs helping for most of the 150 feet of elevation gain. The whole loop is 0.66 miles making this a very family friendly hike. The arch itself is pretty small and unspectacular. The reason it's so popular is not the arch itself, but what it frames. It offers great views of La Sal Mountain, White Rim Road, and the Monster Tower. Be sure to look for trucks and jeeps down on the White Rim Road. I always have fun trying to spot the arch from far below.

2.1,Point to Point,5495,5204,321,129,4,36,Devils Garden Main Trail,Intermediate,4.5,"        However much of the Devils Garden Trail system you complete, you'll leave happy.  From the Devils Garden trailhead, take the initially paved path over mostly level ground between rock fins.  Almost immediately, a signed fork announces the turnoff for Tunnel Arch Trail and Pine Tree Arch Trail.  These are short, easy detours and highly recommended.  

Return to the Devils Garden Main Trail, heading northwest through more widely spaced rock fin valleys.  At the next trail junction, stay left on the Devils Garden Main Trail towards Landscape Arch Trail, ignoring the Devils Garden Primitive Loop trail that heads north.  From here, take the paved path to Landscape Arch Trail and its spectacular viewpoint (more details about this impressive arch can be found on the Landscape Arch Trail trail page).  The part of the trail to Landscape arch is non-taxing and very family-friendly, but past this point be advised to keep kids under close supervision.

Back on the Devils Garden Main Trail, expect increased challenges as your route climbs over sandstone slabs and traverses narrow ledges with some exposure to heights.  Follow rock pile cairns to stay on the correct route.  Soon, you have the option to take the short spurs  Partition Arch Trail and Navajo Arch Trail to the southwest.  

These arches often have shade and make worthwhile detours, but if you're out of stamina or time it is OK to bypass them.  Further along the undulating Devils Garden Main Trail, cross more fins hiking over exposed, sun-baked ground.  After a sharp hairpin bend around the end of a fin, the Devils Garden Main Trail ends at a 3 way junction with the Dark Angel Trail and the Devils Garden Primitive Loop.  If you've got lots of time and energy left, visit Dark Angel and then consider tackling the more rugged Devils Garden Primitive Loop.  If you're already down for the count, better retrace your steps back to the parking area.  

Some words to the wise: take at least 1 quart (1 liter) of water per person, wear a hat, use sunscreen, take breaks. Visit early or late in the day if you want to avoid the crowds on this extremely popular trail.  Note: bikes are not allowed on this trail.

Be wary of dangerous ice during non-summer months and do not proceed to the summit if storms are in the area or if the rock is wet. Be ready for wild temperature swings - from scorching sun on Walter's Wiggle to chilly shade in Refrigerator Canyon. Additionally, the stimulating summit pitch can be windy.

There are chains anchored by posts as optional assistance when the route is exposed. Grab them if you want. Regardless, you'll feel the rush. Exposure eases the last few hundred meters to the summit. Take a seat, stretch, and enjoy the divine view.

7.9,Loop,5738,4238,1649,1649,8,59,Syncline Loop Trail,Difficult,4.8,"        This difficult primitive trail does not feature views of Upheaval Dome per se.  Users should expect many steep climbs, tricky trail conditions and sparingly marked sections.  Most hikers choose to do the loop clockwise so that views are ahead and the sun is at your back for most of the route with an early start.  

From the 3-way intersection near the trailhead, follow the Syncline Loop Trail left, towards the west.  Hike over relatively level, sandy gravel surface next to looming sandstone formations and desert scrub.  Soon you reach a gap at the edge of a large drop off with views across the canyons.  Pay close attention to the cairns as you descend steep switchbacks through a long jumbled gully.  After a short mellow section, plunge down through another drop-off.  Finally, reach a dry wash where the grade eases considerably.  Marvel at the enormous sandstone walls towering above and around you.  Soon, a narrow canyon takes shape and the trail threads along its bottom.  

At the signed intersection with the Upheaval Canyon Trail, turn right to stay on the Syncline Loop Trail as it continues north.  Follow Syncline a short distance until it makes a sharp left and climbs a staircase of rock steps ascending a loose hillside.  Take your time and do not miss this critical route finding challenge.  At the signed junction with the Crater Spur Trail, stay left on the Syncline Loop Trail heading northeast.  What lies ahead is the beautiful Syncline Valley, arguably the most scenic part of the loop.  There are sometimes pools of water near the mouth of the valley that should be filtered before drinking.  A primitive backcountry campsite nearby requires permits for use.  

Next, struggle carefully through the dreaded boulder field, being sure to spot the next cairn ahead before proceeding.  Use an affixed metal cable and clamber over slabs of steep, exposed slickrock to reach a valley oasis with numerous trees.  After climbing a steep valley, the grade eases to be a more pleasant ascent.  Turn to the right and climb through a rugged gap in the canyon walls.  Scale ledges marked by cairns and finally emerge onto a sandy dry wash that threads through juniper and pinion back to the trailhead.  

Please note:  Apparently more users get lost on this route than on any other trail in the park, so concentrate on finding cairns.  If you lose your way, retrace your own footsteps back to the last place you saw a cairn and look for the next marker from there.

1.6,Point to Point,7989,7420,103,608,9,32,Queens Garden Trail,Intermediate,4.5,"        Prepare to be amazed by this magical trip through otherworldly rock formations. This popular trail can be crowded, especially at the top, but the throngs often thin out in the lower reaches. From Sunrise Point, drop into the canyon along a steep but wide trail along a ridgeline. Weave down through towering multicolored spires and past sparsely wooded areas. The most sweeping views occur at the top, but as you descend, the cliffs and hoodoos encroach. After a series of switchbacks and a few man-made tunnels, the descent eases considerably. Proceed through a ravine with multicolored hoodoos galore. Take the short spur to see the Queen Victoria formation - she's in the center viewing the spired garden around her.  

Back on the main trail, cross washes and forest over mostly level ground. Contour around the base of a large cliff formation before reaching a trail junction with the Navajo Loop and Peekaboo - Navajo Connector. The Queens Garden Trail officially ends here, but many nice loops can be constructed from this point.  

Bring yaktrax or other foot traction for winter travel. Some people with a fear of heights have reported feeling nervous in some parts. Keep kids away from the edges.

The Peek-A-Boo Loop can be accessed from both Sunrise and Sunset Points, but arguably the most straightforward and scenic route descends the Peek-A-Boo Loop Connector from Bryce Point. Therefore, this description begins at the southern tip of the loop and goes in the clockwise direction.  

From the ""T"" intersection with the Peek-A-Boo Loop Connector, take the left (western) half of the Peek-A-Boo Loop and pass the seasonal bathrooms. Climb up and down ridges and through steep switchbacks. This is a great treat for intrepid travelers who want to get up close to the colorful, surreal spires. Keep an eye out for the named rock formations: Wall of Windows, Hindu Temples and the Cathedral. After a long downhill section, the western half of the loop ends at the trail's lowest elevation point which is also the intersection of the Peek-A-Boo - Navajo Connector, Peek-A-Boo Connector and the Peek-A-Boo Loop Trails.  

To complete the Peek-A-Boo Loop, continue southwards along the eastern half of the loop now climbing steeply. Surmount a broad ridge and wind through its saddle next to the Fairly Castle rock formation. Another long descent deposits you back on the canyon bottom at a wide wash. Ascend the valley and the last few switchbacks to arrive at the start of the loop (at its southern tip). In case you're wondering, the trail name comes from the natural arch ""windows"" formed in the rocks.

Note: This trail receives heavy use by horse/mule riders - be sure to give them right of way and beware of the poop.

The first mile of the hike is really nice and follows a stream. After you leave the stream, the trail follows the hillside with a number of switchbacks that can get quite hot during the summer.

0.0,Unknown,5248,5242,6,0,2,5,Landscape Arch Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.2,"        The trail to Landscape Arch is rightfully popular (but the arch itself seems mis-named- it sure looks more thin and delicate than Delicate Arch).  How often do you get to see the largest arch on the planet?  At 306 feet long, it beats Zion's Kolob arch by only 3 feet.  Landscape is about 11 feet thick at its center.  

To reach this amazing place, take the Devils Garden Trail to just where the Primitive Loop starts.  From here, take the left (west) fork. The easy Landscape Arch trail turns off the Primitive Trail to the west immediately after the fork.  The old Landscape Arch trail used to go all the way under the arch, but now a fenced viewpoint area is as close as you can get because of well-founded safety concerns.  

In 1991, a few pieces of Landscape Arch started to rain down, and then suddenly a 60 foot long chunk of rock fell from the underside of the arch's thinnest section.  The thin section is now about 5 feet narrower than it used to be.  Some of the large boulders under the arch are the results of this event.  Some folks think that this recent breakage bodes ill for Landscape Arch and that it will soon collapse completely.  Others believe that the arch may have just increased its longevity by shedding some weight and that the new, more balanced arch will persist.  Take your guess, but you best admire this fragile feat of nature while it still exists!

Early morning is thought to be the best time to photograph Landscape Arch for the best color.

0.2,Point to Point,5266,5205,61,0,5,10,Turret Arch Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.3,"        Turret Arch is the smallest of the three arches you'll see on the Windows Loop Trail, but it is part of a more intricate, castle-like rock formation that includes a spire (hence the name).  There are two holes in this formation, one you can walk through and one high up on the rock face.  The views of the north and south Window Arches from inside the Turret Arch are neat.  The trail to Turret Arch is a very gentle incline with only a few stairs.  

To reach Turret Arch from the Windows/Turret parking area, take the Windows Loop in either direction and look for the Turret Arch turn off.  The most direct route would be the leg leaving to the south/southeast (rightmost trail facing the rock formations), the longer route would be the leg leaving north/northeast (leftmost trail facing the rock formations).  But truly, the Windows Loop is delightful and short, so completing the entire loop and all of its spurs is highly recommended.

2.1,Point to Point,4841,4630,700,620,12,43,The Narrows - Wall Street to Big Springs Route,Difficult,4.9,"Hiking in The Narrows requires careful planning before starting, as it is a serious endeavor that can be both challenging and risky. Your safety is your responsibility and requires sound judgment, proper preparation, and constant observation. Contact the Zion park rangers at the visitor center for current water conditions, flash flood potential, and weather forecast.  

Upon reaching the end of The Narrows - Bottom Up Route, Go LEFT to begin this extension. Heading right leads into Orderville Canyon, which is prohibited by the park service.

Wall Street is the narrowest part of The Narrows and is where it truly becomes a slot canyon—at this point, the 2000 foot walls around you close to within 20 feet in areas. At approximately 0.5 miles from the Orderville fork, you'll pass Floating Rock: a giant rock bisecting the river that you can navigate around. 

Further up the canyon, keep your eyes and ears peeled for Hiccup Springs. While it is not very visible, other than a little crack on the left side of the river, you should be able to hear the gurgling noise when approximately 0.8 miles from the Orderville fork.

From here, the water will increasingly deepen in sections and the canyon walls will open up as you approach the Boulder Pair (approximately 1.5 miles). The Boulder Pair is a set of 2 giant boulders that block the river and mark the beginning of the boulder-obstacle portion of the route. While it's not very difficult to get through this obstacle, you'll still want to be careful as it's a long hike out to the parking area.

Next up, you'll find Sipping Turtle (another gurgling noise maker) roughly 1.8 miles from the Orderville fork. From here, it's only another 0.4 miles until you reach Big Springs and the end of your journey—you'll need to stop here unless you have a permit. Big Springs marks a great end to your journey, as the giant boulder and obvious waterfall are a great place to stop, grab some water and lunch, and prepare for your journey out.

The trail initially ascends slowly through a sagebrush meadow with small groves of aspens and conifers throughout it. After less than a quarter of a mile, the trail splits off to the right (taking the trail to the left would take you to Mount Naomi, and it is well marked) and continues through forests and meadows with occasional views of the impressive Mount Magog. 

After about 2 miles from the trailhead, the trail ascends a long switchback and then breaks out into a clearing with amazing views of Mount Gog, another spectacular alpine peak, and if you go in the fall this is also a great place to see some beautiful, brilliant fall colors down below Gog. At this point, the trail starts to descend rapidly down into the White Pine Lake Cirque. 

At about 3.5 miles from the trailhead, the trail crosses a small bridge and then hits a trail junction at the sign that talks about the White Pine Lake Loop Trail and the White Pine-Bunchgrass Canyon Trail. The actual White Pine Lake Trail, instead of crossing the bridge, continues along the south side of the creek and eventually passes by the outlet of White Pine Lake and then follows the shores of the lake around to the north side of the lake where it meets up with the White Pine Lake Loop Trail again, where the trail ends.

EC1 Campground is to the north of this intersection, while the Chesler Park Trail heads south into Elephant Canyon. 

Elephant Canyon is one of the most defined ancient canyons in this district, with red and white rocks towering above you. Continue south along the canyon bottom for about 4/5 of a mile until you come to another intersection with the Big Spring Canyon Trail. Continue south. In about a third of a mile, you'll come to an intersection with Druid Arch Trail. Make a right to head west. 

This next part of the trail involves climbing up and out of Elephant Canyon. Some scrambling is required, but it is more fun than difficult! Once you finish climbing out of the canyon, you'll be rewarded with views of Chesler Park - a flat area filled with desert grasses and walled in with towering red and white rock spires. Multiple campsites are also available to permit holders wishing to spend the night.

It is worth evaluating your water levels and experience over the last half of the Devils Garden Main Trail:  if you were terrified, don't do the Primitive Loop.  If you still feel energetic and successfully conquered the challenges of the Main Trail with aplomb, then you'll likely find the Primitive Loop to be similarly enjoyable.  

From the 3-way junction with Devils Garden Main Trail and the Dark Angel Trail, the Devils Garden Primitive Loop Trail begins with a moderately steep descent of Fin Canyon.  About halfway down, and about 0.4 miles from the beginning of the loop, look for the Private Arch Trail on the right (leading south/southeast).  This worthwhile detour is easy and visits an infrequently seen, isolated arch.    

Once back on the Devils Garden Primitive Loop Trail, continue downhill over rock spines, through sandy washes and slickrock sections, threading between mesmerizing fin canyons.  Some parts in this area become treacherous when the rock is wet or snowy.  There is one rock face that must be navigated via a ledge and another tricky spot where a depression often fills with water and must be circumnavigated.  Most hikers with grippy shoes report excitement without dunkings.  (If you are concerned about these obstacles, you can visit Private Arch and then retrace your steps back to the Devils Garden Main Trail.)

The remainder of the trail covers more open ground, ascending gradually to the junction with the Devils Garden Main Trail at the Landscape Arch area.  Some words to the wise: take at least 1 quart (1 liter) of water per person, wear a hat, use sunscreen, take breaks. This trail is more remote than others in the park, users should be completely self-sufficient.  Note: bikes are not allowed on this trail.

After the creek crossing, the trail ascends slightly and then contours around the ridge that separates White Pine and Red Pine canyons, through brush and forest. In parts, this ascent up Red Pine Canyon can be steep, but is often manageable as the trail is mostly a smooth singletrack with some rocky portions. 

Eventually, the trail meets up with the junction with the Maybird Lakes Trail, and then continues south up Red Pine Canyon instead of crossing the creek. Soon after the trail split, a fork of Red Pine Creek actually crosses the trail and can make it pretty muddy and slippery certain times of the year, but it is generally very shallow. 

After the creek crosses the trail, the trail steepens and gets even more rocky, which can be a challenge for going down but is still pretty fun. Eventually, the steepest part of the trail abates and the slope gets gentler as the trail winds through some meadows right before reaching the lake. The actual Red Pine Lake Trail ends at the northern end of the lake, although there is a trail that goes all the way around the lake, as well as another trail that goes up to upper Red Pine Lake.

The trail starts in a forest canopy but eventually leaves the canopy for a more exposed hillside and from this part you get great views of Logan Canyon and the cliffs that sit underneath the Crimson Trail.

As the trail continues, there are many spur trails but they are usually blocked off or it is easy to see the main trail. Be sure to stay on the main trail because spur trails sometimes lead to nowhere, or to somewhere that you don't want to go, or they just cause erosion on this extremely popular trail, which is discouraged. 

As the trail gets closer to the top of the climb, it starts to level out and finishes out right on top of the wind caves, and it is just a short scramble to get down into the main cave, where you get the best views of Logan Canyon on the whole trail.

4.8,Point to Point,9377,5245,4141,9,16,52,Bells Canyon Trail,Difficult,4.6,"        Starting at the Granite Trailhead, you'll head up a relatively steep grade for about 0.3 miles (nothing too scary, but the difficulty may surprise if you're out of shape). After a few minutes of downhill, you'll head up to the Lower Bell Canyon Reservoir. There are trails around the reservoir, but stay to the left if you want to hit the waterfall. 

You'll follow a dirt road around the left of the reservoir for about 0.2 miles before turning left back onto the Bells Canyon Trail (it's well-marked). After another half-mile, you'll be at a nice creek crossing with a wooden bridge and crystal clear mountain water. This is a great place to stop for a rest. 

Continue on the trail into National Forest land for about a mile until you reach a trail junction at a large fir tree. It's not marked, but there is a well-worn trail that deviates to the left -- this is the side trail to the lower waterfall. Be careful here, as it's quite steep as you approach the falls, but it's definitely worth it. If you want to picnic, there's a great spot on some exposed rocks just below the falls. Most people stop here, but if you're feeling adventurous, why not take the trail to its end?

Backtrack to the main trail and head up another 1.5-2 miles, through forest, meadows, and boulder fields, creekside, until you make it to Upper Bell Canyon Reservoir. It's part of the Salt Lake watershed, so you can't swim in it, but it offers great views of the surrounding peaks. Camp near the reservoir (at least 200 feet from the water), if you want to stay overnight before heading back down.

2.0,Point to Point,5663,5284,43,393,4,17,Joint Trail,Intermediate,4.9,"        Located in a fairly isolated section of The Needles, this trail sees more visitors (relatively) due to its 4X4 access off Devils Lane Road. Starting from the eastern end, just north of the CP2 backcountry campsite, the trail heads south/southwest through the prairie. This ""approach"" provides a great opportunity to see the rocks that the trail will ultimately enter with expansive views beyond to the west. 

After a few hundred yards, the trail will turn right (north/northwest) and skirt the northern border of the rocks; a nice and easy stroll. The trail will begin to descend gradually and then when it arrives at the rocks, at an intersection sometimes marked with a cairn or wooden post, it will appear to vanish. 

Looking to the right, the trail continues down a ladder and enters one of the coolest areas, debatably, in the park. Here the trail travels along the bottom of a slot canyon whose walls begin to stretch higher and higher as the trail continues through the cool, shaded, sandy bottom. For those looking to explore, tighter and taller slots branch off this main route. For folks who are sensitive to tight spaces, this might be a challenging area as the slot can be fairly narrow (less than two body widths or a little greater than shoulder-width). 

Continuing into the slot, there are a couple log ladders to negotiate down some boulders. These aren't too difficult but may present a challenge for shorter and less-able-bodied visitors. Further along, the slot will open up to a large cave that is filled with cairns. This is a neat spot to explore before emerging north towards a more open canyon.

The final stretch of trail meanders through this more open canyon with some undulations along the way. Bending to the left (west, southwest), the trail crosses the Chesler Canyon wash and arrives at a small, yurt-style bathroom and parking area. To the west, the trail continues for a short segment to connect to the intersection of Devils Lane Road and Bobbys Hole Road.

Restrooms are located here along with Forest Service trail maps. Hike up the trail through a forest that alternates between pines and aspens. The trail crosses a small river that comes off of the high lake, take care to cross safely. Normally logs are placed across the small river but can occasionally become treacherous. Continue up the north side of the valley winding along the obvious trail through brush and aspens. 

The trail eventually leads up towards the base of a small dam. Away from the trail, beaver may sometimes be seen in the several pools that stem off from the dam. This is a great spot to sit and spot wildlife. 

Continue up to the lake, passing the dam. You're welcomed by a beautiful alpine view ringed by several high peaks, including White Baldy. After a nice break and perhaps a chilly swim, follow the trail back down to the parking lot.

The trail climbs up onto the Plateau for the first three miles. At 2.8 miles from the East Rim Trailhead, you'll reach Jolly Gulch. This unmistakable canyon seems to drop out beneath your feet as you see it from the trail. The gulch marks a great turnaround point for a shorter hike from the East Entrance and back.

The middle section of the trail wanders across the plateau where the altitude is higher and the weather is a little cooler than the main canyon. The trail passes through a ponderosa pine forest and, after crossing the flat plateau where the ponderosa trees grow, it opens up with amazing views of the Echo Canyon Basin.

Stave Springs is located about five miles from the East Entrance Trailhead or Weeping Rock. It is a pipe in the ground that water comes out of however, it can become dry some years. Be sure and check spring conditions for an update. Near the springs, the Cable Mountain Trail branches off to the left (west). Shortly after, north of the springs, Stave Spring Trail branches to the right and leads to a dirt road which is part of the Zion Ponderosa Ranch Resort.

Approximate Location of the Spring: 
N 3715'40.2""
W 11254'17.1""
Elevation 6493 ft

After hiking over the rim of the canyon, you sharply descend 2,300 feet down to the floor of Zion Canyon ending at Weeping Rock, passing through Echo Canyon and down the Observation Point Trail. 

The East Rim Trail trail is best in the late spring and fall. The trail typically has deep snow in the winter that can remain until late spring. During the summer months the trail can get very dry and hot. This area has no established campsites but does require a permit and is available on a walk-up basis.

5.9,Point to Point,6116,4409,293,1891,7,74,Lathrop Canyon Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Before Canyonlands was designated as a national park, Howard Lathrop blazed this trail into the canyons so he could get his and others’ supplies to and from the river and to their grazing sheep. Though sheep were eventually banned from the park, the route has since been kept alive as a hiking trail. 

Traveling first across Gray’s Pasture–a flat, expansive plain stretching miles along the canyon rim--relics from the area’s early days still litter the trail. One mile in, look towards the La Sal mountains in the northeast, where you can spot an old shed in the distance. Lathrop and the other ranchers would use this cabin to store their supplies before descending into the depths.

Where Gray's Pasture melds into the slickrock, the horizon offers up a dramatic landscape of heavily eroded canyon walls and geological wonders surrounding the Colorado River two-thousand feet below. A more diverse canvas of vegetation thrives here, including blackbrush, juniper, pinon and sagebrush.

Many choose to turn back here, so continue on and you may have the trail to yourself. Straying east before wrapping back to the west, the route circles an outcrop of Navajo Sandstone, quickly losing elevation as it drops onto the first narrow bench below the canyon walls. Just below you, the sheer cliffs of red Wingate Sandstone make access points into or out of the canyon few and far between, but Lathrop Canyon makes use of an ancient landslide to find its entry.

Descending nearly fifteen-hundred feet along a series of tight boulder-strewn and cairn-marked switchbacks, the route meets up with the braided wash inside Lathrop Canyon, never losing its vantage of the Colorado River throughout these one and a half miles. And remember, what goes down, must come up.

Heading west, the trail finds a raised spine and a better viewpoint for a glimpse at the southern cluster of the La Sal Mountains and United Nations Tablet (A.K.A. Mitten Butte). Gradually losing ground again, the route soon meets with White Rim Road. Combined with Lathrop Canyon Road (a mountain biking trail), this route is one of only a few in the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands giving hiking entry to the riverside.

As a note, remember to bring plenty of water for the scorching desert heat of the summertime. 100+ degree weather is common from June through August.

1.4,Point to Point,6001,5405,667,81,10,78,Cassidy Arch Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.7,"        The trail begins gaining elevation rapidly via well-made switchbacks leading up the canyon wall. The trail is easy to navigate and climb via the well marked and maintained route along the canyon rim. The views along the trail are worth every minute and drop of sweat throughout the trip.

As you continue along the trail after the series of switchbacks, the trail will continue to skirt the canyon rim until you reach a section of the trail at a dry wash where you must take a sharp left continuing on and up the trail. (Beware of this section because the path appears to continue straight through the soft sand wash, and misleading footprints are common. A few rocks blocking the wash try to prevent you from continuing straight in the wrong direction)  

After taking the left at this wash, you begin a slight climb, and eventually head around a bend to your first breathtaking view of the canyon, surrounding cliffs and in the distance to the right Cassidy Arch. Continue to follow the trail until you reach a sign at a fork for different trails. Follow the directions and arrow for Cassidy Arch trail to the left and down a few steps from the sign for another 0.5 miles. 

As you continue on the last stretch of the trail you'll begin to notice an increase in cairns and desert wood marking the route.  You'll start to lose the distinct dirt trail and begin to ascend slightly across and up slick rock formations. Follow the cairns along the slick rock which eventually guides you to the grand view of the Cassidy Arch. From this incredible view, you can also work your way out safely onto the larger more structured arch capturing amazing pictures and views.

Completing the circle using both trails ends up being about 8 miles.

From the Fairyland Point parking area, dip down into the canyon heading northeast on the well marked trail. As you descend steadily, the impressive Fairyland amphitheater of hoodoos is sandwiched in on your right between the trail and Boat Mesa. Watch for the Sinking Ship formation across the valley to the east. After about 1.5 miles, the trail reaches its lowest point and begins a stiff climb up to a saddle and the cliffs below the Coliseum. From here the grades ease a bit until the  Tower Bridge Side Trail turnoff - note that it's well worth the short detour to ogle Mother Nature's creativity.  

Once back on the main Fairyland Loop Trail, begin the challenging climb up through parched Campbell Canyon, also crossing its namesake creek. The meandering trail ascends steadily through open terrain passing the Chinese Wall formation to the south.

It is also one of the better places to escape park crowds, making it practically a ""must do"" for any itinerary. Despite its name, it is not a perpetually sweltering place (it can be quite cool in the canyon shadows at times). Rather, it was given the name due to the warm glow of the rocks in the late afternoon sun. According to the National Park Service, the chaos of the fins, spires, and canyons is ""void, silent, and almost uncanny in its solitude."" The area is usage-restricted, at least partially for safety purposes, as there are no trails, signs, or cairns. Those wishing to visit must either accompany a ranger-guided tour or obtain a permit at the Arches National Park Visitor Center. Both have $10 fees. For those navigationally-inclined, exploring alone affords enhanced solitude and adventure. However, the ranger-guided tours have their own set of benefits, such as interesting geological and anthropological features within the Fiery Furnace (like the amazing fairy shrimp crustacean) that often go unnoticed or would remain unknown to most visitors. No water or restrooms are available in the Fiery Furnace. Length and elevation gain will be subject to individual discretion.

12.1,Point to Point,11867,9440,2473,489,5,35,Henry's Fork Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.7,"        From the parking lot of this trail, you can expect a series of rolling hills for the many miles leading up to Gunsight Pass. The trail undulates as it generally follows Henry's Fork (of the Green River) up through the long drainage. The trail can be very rocky and rooty at times, and is seldom smooth, but it is great for a quick ascent, due to the low grade. 

The trail crosses tributary creeks many times, and often has foot bridges (which in some places are slightly dilapidated), but the trail can still get muddy in places, even during the summer, especially when there is a lot of snowmelt. At approximately mile 3.5, the trail heads away from Henry's Fork and out of the forests and into some more open meadows where you can start to get views of the impressive headwalls and peaks around the Henry's Fork drainage. 

At approximately mile 5, there is a major crossing of Henry's Fork, but there is a wooden bridge across the river with a handrail that makes the crossing easier. After this crossing, the trees become more and more sparse as the trail heads up into higher elevations, and crosses several more tributary creeks (several of the crossings after the Henry's Fork crossing do not have foot bridges, and the trails can get pretty muddy in the area leading up to Dollar Lake) on the way to Dollar Lake, which is a popular area for camping. Dollar Lake itself cannot be seen from the trail, but the trail passes very close to it and it is worth the quick detour to go and check it out. 

After passing the forested area near Dollar Lake, the basin really opens up and you can get good views of Gunsight Peak, and even the tip of Kings Peak as you head up towards Gunsight Pass. This area is full of great views and wildflowers (in season) and is definitely worth the 8 miles it took to get there. The trail starts to increase in grade slightly at this point as it heads up towards Gunsight Pass. 

As the trail nears the base of Gunsight Pass, there is a fork in the trail that allows you to either head straight up towards the pass or to the right along a gradual switchback that also heads up to the pass. Both routes are rocky but the long switchback is more manageable (both up and down). Either way, the trail hits Gunsight Pass, where there is a large rock cairn and some great views into Painter Basin. From the pass, the trail continues down into Painter Basin which eventually heads up towards Kings Peak, and ends at the Uinta Highline Trail about 1.5 miles from Anderson Pass.

The first stretch of trail climbs gradually through juniper bushes and pinyon pine. After the one-third of a mile warm-up, the trail begins its main ascent, switchbacking up a slope comprised of the light-colored Chinle Formation. Continue upwards to where the trail splits.

Heading left at the fork provides the quickest access to Chimney Rock Canyon, while heading right gives hikers the best opportunity to take in the views to the south and southeast. 

In the counter-clockwise direction (right and south), the trail passes a series of shaded, ledge benches that can be a great spot to take a break along the climb. However, the best views are yet to come at the top of the ascent. 

From the top, look to the east for views of the Navajo Knobs above Fruita and a not-often-seen view of the Castle above Hwy 24 to the southeast and Panorama Point to the southwest. 

The trail continues to the east, descending very quickly through a number of boulders that have fallen from the Wingate Cliffs above. After a few hundred yards, the trail intersects the Chimney Rock Canyon trail to the east. From here, continue straight and west along a very gradual upward grade. Be on the lookout along this initial stretch of trail for small chunks of petrified wood and a larger log. 

Continue to the stem trail, heading back down the loose switchbacks to the parking area below.

Take the Grand Wash road as it turns into a dirt road and continues to the northeast. A sign posted at the turn warns visitors not to enter if storms are forecast, and it is important to take this warning seriously. Visitors will follow the dirt road for about 3/4 mile until a  parking lot is reached. There is a pit toilet at the parking lot. 

The trailhead is located at the north end of the lot with plenty of signage. Follow the trail until it splits (Cassidy Arch to the left, Grand Wash to the right). The Wash is a dry streambed, consisting mostly of gravel and sand, and continues northeast until reaching the Fremont River at Highway 24. The route gently descends for most of the journey out, though at 1.5 miles, you'll notice a short and very steep portion. The trail mellows again almost immediately. About a mile into the trail, you enter the Narrows, which offers stunningly steep walls on each side.

Many visitors will walk through the Narrows until the canyon widens again and turn around at this point instead of walking the full length of the wash. Walking in sand can become tiresome, so you might save your energy for another hike and do the same.

At the fork between the two, keep to the right/southwest and follow the dirt path to a small section of rock. Some very easy scrambling/big steps will take you up this. Keep an eye out for cairns on the solid rock surfaces as the trail may be hard to see. 

After the small rock section, you'll be on flat, dirt canyon floor. You'll pass the Big Spring to Elephant Canyon Trail on your right after 0.75 miles. Continue south along the mostly flat canyon bottom. As you go, the rock walls on either side of you'll get higher and higher until they tower over you. 

Just after 2.5 miles, the trail begins to climb. You're going to transfer out of the Big Spring Canyon and into Squaw Canyon - an excellent section of scrambling leads to amazing canyon views from the top at Squaw Canyon Overlook. The scrambling here can look intimidating, but it's really not too hard, and totally worth it. The sandstone provides great traction as long as it's dry. This may be a spot you choose to turn around at if you want a short hike.

Enjoy the views for a bit and then descend into Squaw Canyon. Squaw Canyon Trail heads north, and makes an excellent loop (see Big Spring Canyon/Squaw Canyon Loop Trail). Continue east around the rock pillar and curve back to the southwest. The trail follows a wide rock ledge that is marked by occasional cairns.

Little Wild Horse Canyon is fairly narrow, and you'll want to be aware that there are some tight squeezes and drop-offs along the way. The trail narrows pretty quickly, though the first 1.5 miles from the trailhead are mostly open.  

From the trailhead, and the junction with the Bell's Canyon Trail, you'll enter the narrow passageway that winds through Little Wild Horse Canyon. This is as alien as it is beautiful, and you'll probably want to break out the camera for some photos. 

Once you've made the through the narrows, you'll follow the canyon for 3 small drops, with the first one being about 6' high into a small pool of water.  You can avoid the water if you're careful and use the log and stone bridge.  

The toughest obstacle is the last one, a pour off about 10' high, and you can scramble up next to it on either side (Class 4 on the left and Class 3 on the right, facing down-canyon), or you can notice that a ramp on the right side leads easily to the top from the canyon floor. Other obstacles are no harder than Class 3. This is the trickiest obstacle for a dog and where a harness comes in handy. 

Most visitors link this trail with the Bell's Canyon Trail, and finish their journey in this canyon. Both trails highlight the gorgeous desert sandstone, and are about equal in terrain.

1.0,Point to Point,9106,9012,92,109,4,13,Bristlecone Loop,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        From the Rainbow Point parking and picnic area, follow the Bristlecone Loop Trail as it initially heads east. Soon, arrive at a junction and pick a direction to complete the lollipop loop - either way works, but this description takes the clockwise direction. Descend atop the mesa through densely forested terrain, crossing other trail junctions.  

Proceed along the loop passing many gnarled,1,800 year-old Bristlecone Pines. These trees are some of the oldest living beings on earth. By studying their tree rings, scientists can learn about past environmental conditions like glaciers and drought going back thousands of years. Unlike other pines which shed their needles every couple of years, Bristlecone Pines can keep their same needles for as long as 40 years - a strategy that saves energy and helps the trees endure harsh temperatures and drought. These trees also have very resinous wood which prevents the trees from drying out and being damaged by insects. These twisted trees only grow on certain rocky slopes at precise elevations in six US states and are under federal protection so don't collect cones or otherwise damage them! 

The trail skirts the edge of picturesque cliffs with viewpoints along the way. You'll see deep canyons, hoodoos, and at the end of the point, enjoy sweeping vistas.  Begin the undulating climb back up through forested slopes, keeping an eye out for the famous Bristlecone Pines. Rejoin the ""stem"" of the lollipop to head back to the parking area.

0.5,Point to Point,6003,5877,127,0,5,16,Strike Valley Overlook Trail,Intermediate,5.0,"        You can access the start point for this incredible view point via the Upper Muley Twist Access Road. Follow the distinct trail that begins east just to the right of the sign. This dirt trail continues with ease for about a few hundred feet then takes a sharp right and down a few steps into a small wash. Continue to the left within the small wash, consisting of softer sand, till you reach the end. 

You'll come upon a 25-foot section of slick rock before the steeper incline rock section. It may be hard to view the continuation of the trail at the end of the small wash and across the slick rock to base of the incline, but just continue straight across and begin your ascent. Pay close attention because there may be cairns marking the continuing trail to help guide you. The cairns continue gradually up the trail and can assist to reaching the top of the viewpoint. 

When you reach the top, you'll notice a fairly large pile of stones, this marks the completion of the trail. The Strike Valley Viewpoint spans to the left and right along the sandstone cliff safely for about 500 feet in both directions giving you widespread views of the Waterpocket Fold in the valley below and incredible distant views of the Henry Mountains.

Special considerations: This area can be extremely hot in the late spring and summer seasons. There is very little shade from the sun along the trail and at the viewpoint, as well as no water along the route.

3.1,Point to Point,6053,5184,954,1095,12,46,Crimson Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.9,"        This trail can be traversed either from the Guinavah Campground or from the Spring Hollow Trail, and either way is beautiful. The way that will be described below is the route from Spring Hollow.

From the split with the Spring Hollow Trail, the trail starts to ascend some switchbacks which quickly do away with the elevation gain. It tends to climb steeply at times, but never gets too bad, thanks to the switchbacks. Eventually, you rise out of the forested area of Spring Hollow to the exposed hillside which lets you get some great views of Logan Canyon, and before you know it, you are done with the short 600 foot climb, and the trail levels out and allows for some easy hiking. 

The trail then goes in and out of a few drainages that cut through the China Wall (the cliff band that the trail sits on top of), and as a result goes in and out of wooded areas that are beautiful in and of themselves, especially in the fall when the colors are changing and gorgeous. The trail gets close to the edge of the cliffs several times, which gives you some great views of the cliffs themselves which are really spectacular up close. The trail goes up and down as you cross the top, but eventually reaches the apex near the eastern end and then starts to descend somewhat steeply through the drainage on the eastern end. 

As the trail goes down, you end up being able to get some really good views of the China Wall if you stop and take a look, as the trail descends right along the base. There are even certain spots that actually make the cliffs look like a brick wall because of the fractures in the rock. The trail then continues to go down and eventually gets back into the wooded areas and drops back to the trailhead on the eastern side at the Guinavah campground.

1.6,Point to Point,10220,9388,832,0,10,25,Catherine's Pass,Intermediate,4.7,"        From the trailhead, you'll follow in the shadow of ski lifts as you rise above Albion Basin. Looking across the basin, you'll have wonderful views of Devil's Castle and the rest of Alta Ski Resort.

After an initial climb, things level off for about 0.25 miles until another short climb brings you to an alpine meadow (a bog in the Spring). This is the best spot to see moose and other wildlife and also top off your water in a mountain spring. There are several great campsites on the left side of the meadow.

One more 0.25-mile climb and you're at Catherine Pass, where you can enjoy sweeping views of Lakes Catherine, Martha, and Mary, as well as Mt. Wolverine and Sunset Peak.

1.0,Point to Point,8260,7693,2,569,11,28,Peek-A-Boo Loop Connector,Intermediate/Difficult,4.7,"        This is one of several good ways to reach the popular and delightful Peek-A-Boo Loop Trail. Starting from the parking area at Bryce Point, switchback steeply down from the rim, crossing many cliff bands. Contour below rock walls, crossing ridges and bluffs, all the while steadily losing elevation. 

Keep a look out for the named hoodoo rock formations along the way. The abundance and variety of these colorful piles are the highlight of this trail. After a relatively level section of trail, plunge into the neighboring canyon by navigating a series of hairpin turns down the hill. The Peek-A-Boo Loop Connector ends at a ""T"" intersection with the southern tip of the Peek-A-Boo Loop.

At this point, it is wise to evaluate your energy levels before starting on the 3 mile Peek-A-Boo Loop Trail - save some strength for the taxing climb up and out of the canyon!

1.2,Point to Point,6044,4769,1275,0,20,153,Waterfall Canyon Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.2,"        The first half of the hike is on an easy graded hiking trail. Then you'll cross a small wooden bridge, and this is when you’ll have to slow down as the trail surface changes to just rocks. The last 100 meters are a little steeper than before and are more muddy and wet but not too slick thanks to the high rock quantity. If hiking with a dog, the last 100 meters will slow you down since they will have to climb. The trail ends at a scenic waterfall.

Note that it is possible to hike beyond the waterfall to Malan's Basin, if it is within your sphere of acceptable risk.  Look for the path of least resistance and never climb up anything you wouldn't feel comfortable climbing back down.

12.6,Point to Point,9886,7613,1074,2593,6,21,Wasatch Crest,Intermediate/Difficult,4.9,"        Wasatch Crest is one of those routes that satisfies the soul of anyone who likes to hike.  It's high alpine with 360 views just about the entire time - you're definitely up there and out there.

The Crest has multiple access points (Big Cottonwood Canyon, Mill Creek Canyon and Park City) - choose your own adventure and level of challenge.  Starting from Park City will provide a good dose of moderate climbing and multiple loop options.  This makes a good shuttle hike if you start from the top of Guardsman Pass.

Between the Pinecone and the Crest Connector the trail is not overly technical but still provides a handful of challenges.  Be prepared for the Fakies, a series of short climbs that punctuate a fun descent.

5.8,Point to Point,9104,6085,3033,301,11,34,Smithfield Canyon Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,5.0,"        From the parking lot/trailhead, the trail starts ascending for a short period of time but then levels off as you start going through some meadows near the creek. Once in the meadow you start crossing the creek (which can be somewhat high in April and May, but starts to subside later in the summer) with intervals of meadow and forest in between. Early on in the season, when the snow is just starting to melt, waterfalls can be seen cascading off of the snowfields up above and down into the canyon. 

The trail goes up even further, and you can hike to a ridge where you can then drop into Tony Grove, if you feel up to it. If not, this is a beautiful, short trail providing just enough challenge to keep you on your toes. It's beautiful the whole way and well-worth the journey!

1.1,Point to Point,10790,9878,912,155,19,76,Devil's Castle Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Starting at the edge of Cecret Lake, and following the shore of the lake into the trees, the trail starts out climbing onto the small ridge overlooking the lake. Once into the trees, you'll pass a small cairn made of three stones on your right. Once the trail leaves the trees, it immediately starts to climb, crisscrossing the mountain up to the saddle. Be sure to take short stops to catch your breath as you ascend, both to ease the climb and take in the beautiful views!

Once you get on top of the saddle, which is a lot wider at this point than you would expect, keep following the trail, where you'll pass a rock fort that someone has constructed. As you follow the ridgeline toward Devil's Castle, it will narrow, and you'll find the trail, as well as the easier path along the ridge, to be just below the ridgeline on the right-hand side facing Devil's Castle. 

About halfway toward the peak, the ridge will get a little more technical, requiring some scrambling. As you approach the final part of the ridge to the peak, you'll want to remain on the right side of the ridgeline, as the northern cliff face is popular with rock climbers ascending to the ridge. You'll see a sign reminding you of this as well. 

Once you get close, you'll be able to see why they called this Devil's Castle. Find a way up using the crevices running up the rock; there are plenty of hand and footholds, and multiple ways to the top. Once on the top of Devil's Castle, there are many nice places to sit and take in the beautiful view of the surrounding countryside.

The trail takes a direct route up the western face of the Wasatch Front. The first mile or so has very little underbrush and no shade to speak of. This portion of the trail has loose gravel and sand over hardpacked dirt below so be sure you wear shoes with decent traction.  

Higher up, the trail becomes rockier, sticking to the ridgeline, and showcases yellow and blue wildflowers, a few, scraggly trees and lovely views of the valley, Mount Olympus, and the adjacent canyons. It's an intense climb, but the views up top make it worth it.

After coming around the corner and within view of La Verkin Creek, the trail descends the slope down to the creek bottom on a hard packed trail. 

Once on the creek bed, the trail heads upstream offering amazing views of the surrounding cliffs. The trail is 7 miles from Lee Pass to Kolob Arch, one of the main destinations of the route and possibly the world's largest free-standing arch.

The trail heads south from a small pullout on the south side of the road where parking is available. (Additional parking is available at the visitor center).

The trail passes through large groves of ponderosa pine and winds in and out of stunning rock walls composed of layers of red and yellow rock. There are several great viewpoints along the way where hikers can stop to take in views of Red Canyon. The trail can be combined with the Buckhorn Trail #33037 and the Red Canyon Bicycle Trail to make a loop.

The trail was named for the large section of vertical golden rock walls. There are also many unique spires, hoodoos, pinnacles and other formations along the trail.

The trail is marked with cairns, and requires some rock scrambling up a steeper slope as you get closer to the top. It can be particularly windy on the butte so an extra layer is advised. The top is about 400 meters around. This trail is less popular than some of the others in Canyonlands and offers a bit more seclusion.

6.5,Point to Point,5424,5006,1261,1664,9,67,Wolverine Creek Trail,Intermediate,5.0,"        The trail starts in the Wolverine Petrified Wood Natural Area—the second largest fossil forest in North America. It is about 1 mile from the trailhead to a large field of petrified wood. Keep a very close eye to the right of the trail since there are no signs and the petrified wood is not really obvious unless you know what you are looking for.

The canyon is still very wide for another mile past the petrified wood. A large side canyon joins from the left at 2.7 miles. Then Wolverine Canyon narrows quickly. Negotiating the canyon is still fairly easy, but you need to find your way through some of the boulder fields. The first part of the narrows can be wet and is lined with cottonwood trees and often covered with white mineral deposits. As you get deeper into the narrows, the canyon gets more and more scenic. The red Wingate Sandstone creates a very pleasant canyon feeling. Wolverine Canyon has several massive overhanging walls, the most impressive one at 4.2 miles. 

Past the wet section, the trail is very rocky. At 5.2 miles the canyon walls narrow even further until they are about 5 feet apart. Past the narrows, the trail is smooth gravel and easy going. A wide Horse Canyon will emerge somewhat unexpectedly at 6.5 miles.

5.6,Point to Point,5395,5143,382,184,2,7,South Rim Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        The Gooseberry Mesa trail network sits at 5200 feet elevation on a slickrock mesa. The trail is marked with white paint dots on the slickrock and signs at the junctions. The network is a bit of a maze, but fairly easy to follow. The trail undulates up and down house size sandstone mounds and twists through tight rock canyons. It's the perfect technical trail. There are many ways to connect the various trails to make it longer or shorter, harder or easier, and they're all good.  If this is your first time, you may want to test your mettle on the Practice Trail first to get your Gooseberry groove on. Bring lots of water. There is no drinking water available on the mesa.  There is primitive camping available in the area.

This trail leaves directly from the White Trailhead heading south, and ends at the viewpoint on the west end of the mesa. This is the most technical trail in the Gooseberry Mesa trail network.  The climbs, and descents, are larger and this trail dances on the edge in several places.  Of course, this makes the vistas even better.

3.9,Point to Point,9077,4878,4199,0,20,68,Bair Canyon Trail,Difficult,4.7,"        From the trailhead in Fruit Heights, you'll begin a strenuous climb in the canyon for approximately 2.5 miles. Be warned that you'll cross the creek 3 times but only get your feet wet at the second crossing in early summer. After ~2.5 miles you begin a steep ascent up out of the canyon on the north side. You can see the radar towers from this and multiple points, but don't be deceived...they are still far away. 

Continue along a ridge, then bank right, and then up the side of the ridge through a beautiful fern forest. After this point you come out to the exposed mountainside where you have still about 1.5 miles to go. The last 3/4 mile is straight up and the locals call it ""dead man's march."" You'll top out on the road, which doubles as part of the Great Western Trail at this point. If you like, you can hike ~1 mile south to the radar towers, but the road is the end of the actual Bair Canyon Trail.

Once you reach the top, you might have cause to celebrate, but the hike/run down is very painful on the quads because of the steepness. You may be sore for days, but don't let any of this stop you. 

The trail is beautiful, in the shade much of the time, and you won't see many people after the third and last river crossing. There are many small waterfalls and great views out into the valley. As a side note, this trail is also beautiful in the winter because the snow gets deep and not many people visit. 

Note: The switchbacks at the top of the trail have grown over and it is just straight up at the end.

It connects the visitor center with the Dead Horse Point Overlook at the southern tip of Dead Horse Point. You can connect with the East Rim Trail to make a loop.

Before you head out, take enough time to soak in the spectacular views at Dead Horse Point Overlook. Observe the meandering Colorado River that you'll see more as you hike along the west rim. The first 300 yards from the overlook are paved, it then turns into a narrower dirt trail with the occasional cairns to guide the way. After about half a mile, you reach the Neck, a very narrow stretch in the plateau that you are hiking on, barely wider than the road. 

Follow the outline of the rim and reach Meander Overlook after about a mile. If offers more views of the Colorado River. Shortly after the overlook, you reach the Shafer Canyon Overlook Spur Trail on your left - a worthwhile side trip. Continue to follow the trail north until you reach the Rim Overlook Spur Trail at two miles. This is yet another great opportunity for a side trip. 

The trail then heads east across Dead Horse Point. As you cross over to the east rim, the La Sal Mountains will rise on the horizon. At 2.3 miles, Bighorn Overlook Trail is to your left.

2.8,Point to Point,6438,5646,693,1019,12,31,Frying Pan Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.3,"        The Frying Pan Trail is a point-to-point trail that can be accessed from the Cohab Canyon Trail or Cassidy Arch Trail, beginning in Grand Wash. The best views can be enjoyed by hiking south-to-north from the Cassidy Arch Trail. 

From the southern trail junction in Grand Wash, bear right at the sign to begin the climb along a moderate grade that eventually passes the tip of a prominent, white-capped red point. After about two-thirds of a mile, the slope eases, and for the next half mile, the trail passes through a mellow piñon-juniper forest that imparts the sense of a garden. A little more than a mile in, the highpoint of the hike is reached. This is a fine place to enjoy lunch.

If the day is hot, just over the highpoint is a small, shaded alcove along the trail. Just off the trail to the right, an open ledge makes an excellent viewpoint. On clear days, the La Sal Mountains east of Moab are visible above the typical Mancos Formation mesas. To the northeast is flat Horse Mesa, capped by the Carmel Formation and swinging further left, the domes in the Navajo Sandstone stand out, especially in low early evening light when they cast long shadows.

During the long descent that follows, the Frying Pan, essentially a vast canyon, is laid out in full view of the northbound hiker, with a variety of interesting Kayenta erosional structures visible in the distance. The trail continues down the slope of the Kayenta, occasionally dropping from one layer to the next. It is more than a mile from the top to a sandy wash crossing.

A worthwhile diversion leads to the right to the top of a high pour-off. This drainage forms the handle of the Frying Pan and extends into the Navajo Sandstone. Under the dryfall is a series of tanks in the bedrock below. They are quite evenly spaced, and the line of eight or nine of them is unusual.

On the main trail and on the other side of the wash crossing, the trail climbs about half a mile to the base of a prominent pillar. Just ahead, a good viewpoint looks into the canyon to the west and a wall of Wingate solution cavities. From the pillar, good views to the north once again emerge.

Cohab Canyon shortly begins to appear to the west. The descent to Cohab Canyon is often on slickrock, but it doesn't take too long to travel. A little more than halfway down, the rock is littered with sandy Moki marbles, both those released by weathering and some still embedded. The northern trail junction is soon reached above the floor of the canyon.

I've done them all, and can tell you that in all cases, the trail pretty much disappears, leaving you to tap into your route-finding skills.  Note that this is a great place to snow-shoe in the winter time.

Find the pull-out on the west side of Little Valley Road. You'll hike from here up the road a short distance to find the start of the trail on the east side. Note that, unfortunately, parking in the pull-out at the start of the trail is no longer permitted.

Following the loop in a clock-wise direction, you'll first encounter the Indian bath-tubs (if you take a short detour), Christmas Tree Lane (a narrow corridor walled in on both sides by big and little evergreens), Hell Hole Camp (named by the scouts), Pretty Valley (another charming place to camp), and finally, El Cap Rock (named thus by the locals due to its resemblance to El Capitan.)  Before reaching Pretty Valley, you can also take a detour to Prayer Rock. At Hell Hole Camp, you can take a detour to several waterfalls.

1.3,Point to Point,7375,5073,2302,0,34,91,Saddleback Mountain Trail,Difficult,4.2,"        This is a great trail for people looking for some steep terrain. It goes straight up a ridge and gains about 2,500 feet in a little over a mile. It is a good quality trail almost the entire way though, and in the summer there are lots of beautiful wildflowers along the trail.

This mountain can be seen from just about anywhere in Logan, and is differentiated from other mountains by the reflector towers at the top. From the trailhead, the trail starts slowly ascending through some grassy fields but pretty soon starts to ascend more steeply. Near the beginning, there is an interesting rock formation that you can actually go right through - it looks almost like a throne of sorts. 

Past this, the trail continues to go up and passes some more interesting rock formations on its way towards the top of the peak. The trail starts to ease up just as it gets close to the top, although it also becomes much harder to find at the top, as the vegetation becomes scattered and makes everything look like a trail. However, it is easy from this point to just head for the reflector towers to finish the trail.

It is not nearly as crowded as some of the other hikes in the area (I'm talking about you, Timpanogos), but not remote enough that you'll be completely isolated. 

The first half of the trail is pretty well-shaded, but after that you are out in the open. Keep an eye out for wildflowers along the trail as well, and enjoy the aspen groves and fir stands! The grade is fairly consistent, until a couple of sections near the end, where it can get pretty steep. In early June parts of the trail near the end were still covered in large snow patches, so you may have to get a little creative to get around them or be careful while crossing them. 

Before reaching the top, there is a picturesque little pond. The water can be somewhat stagnant, but you may happen to see hordes of small butterflies flitting around near patches of mud. This can be a good stopping point for group members who may not be up to making the steep ascent to the peak. At the top there are nice views of the surrounding valley, as well as a mailbox with a logbook in it. Enjoy the view, sign the log, and head back down.

The Moab Canyon Paved Path has got to be one of the most scenic paved paths around.  It connects the Courthouse Wash trailhead near Arches National Park with Highway 313 that leads to Canyonlands National Park.  Along the way, the trail provides access to the Bar M trails and the Mag 7 trails (Gemini Bridges).

From the bottom end near Arches, the route climbs steadily and travels through Moab Canyon, tucked beneath huge red sandstone cliffs.  The route levels out quite a bit as you hike along the heart of the Bar M trails.  

Near the main Bar M trailhead the pathway ducks under Hwy 191 and connects with the Gemini Bridges parking area.  From here the route descends and climbs gradually to its terminus at Hwy 313.

This also acts as the southern loop of the Tour of Antelope Island (Buffalo Run 25k/50k route).  Most people do this trail counter-clockwise which means a fast descent down to the Split Rock on a fire road and then a decent singletrack switchback climb back up to the top.  You can also hike it clockwise however.  The full loop is about 5 miles and has an interesting historical horse corral at the high point of the trail.  A sign detailing the history is located there, and there are a few places to sit, rest, and refuel.

You can expect to see views of the Pine Valley Mountain range, surrounding mesas, and the towering temples of Zion National Park. In the surrounding vegetation you can see prickly pear, sage, and other desert plants that bloom in the spring and summer. The trail hugs the mesa's edge for much of it's length, so stay aware of the cliff edges and tripping hazards. Overall it is an easy hike with just a few small ups and downs on relatively smooth trail.

2.0,Point to Point,5757,5312,480,36,5,39,Druid Arch Trail,Difficult,4.7,"        This wonderful trail begins from the Chesler Park Trail where it leaves Elephant Canyon to head west. The Druid Arch trail heads south, continuing in Elephant Canyon. For the first one and a quarter miles, the trail follows the canyon bottom along a mix of sand, rock, and loose gravel, which makes for easy going. 

After the 1.25 miles, you'll need to keep an eye out for when the trail abruptly leaves the bottom of the wash on the left (east). Despite the large number of cairns marking this departure from the wash, it is still super easy to miss as it looks like a drainage. If you do miss it, no big deal - you'll soon realize what you've done when the trail disappears into thick brush and a small pool.

This also is where the trail will begin to gain more elevation and require scrambling. Head up and out of the wash, and over a ~10 foot scramble. It's really not too difficult and I'd say adds to the interactive-fun of the outing (there are many such scrambles in Needles). A little more elevation and you'll be on a ledge that follows parallel to the canyon bottom. Continue heading south on this flat section, which can become narrow but never so narrow as to feel exposed. You'll also see the dry falls that are why you needed to exit the bottom of the wash. 

You'll come to a spot where the canyon turns more to the east and here the trail rejoins the canyon bottom. Head up this wash. Basically continue along the wash bottom - it's relatively easy going but there will be a few mini-scrambles - as it bends around to head south again. You'll come to a section of the wash that is quite steep, but navigable. The sandstone offers good traction when dry, but could pose problems if wet! (On the return we kind of had to sit and slide back down). 

After the steep wash, keep an eye out for where the trail heads east and leaves the wash again. This time is not so difficult to see. You're basically at the bottom of Druid Arch now, but won't be able to see it yet. There is some semi-exposed scrambling you'll have to do to get over some large rocks. A metal bar is bolted to one to offer you a place to put your feet. Some people will be uncomfortable with this section, so be sure to know your limits and turn back if necessary. 

Continuing on, you'll head into a gap between canyon walls and come to one of the steepest parts: a rockfall that will require a little more scrambling. At the top - Druid Arch! One of the more magnificent and less-visited arches in the area. 

It is easier navigation on the way out, but some people don't drop into the wash soon enough and reach a dead end. Keep a few landmarks in mind on your way in, and you'll be able to retrace your steps.

As it goes, it follows the river very closely and every so often there are benches and signs that talk about the natural history of the area, including the bird habitats and vegetation, etc. Sometimes the river grasses are very tall and the trees thick enough to block views of the canyon, but other times the views open up and you can see the mountains on the north side of Logan Canyon, and the views are great. 

You also pass several rock outcroppings on the south side of the trail, each of which is pretty interesting if you stop to take a closer look at them. As the trail gets closer to the end, it goes up for a little bit before descending down into the parking lot at the Guinavah campground.

Head up the paved access path; just around the first corner, the trail starts to the left and bears east. Follow the trail up through the spruce tress, across the Hidden Valley access road, down the stairs and across the bridge.

Several rocky, technical sections break up the otherwise smooth singletrack. The views are unbelievable, including lookouts near the water tower.

Further down, you can take the 185-foot long Bear Canyon Suspension Bridge; be careful not to look down as it's nearly a 100-foot drop to the river below.

The trail passes the access points to Ralph's, Jacob's Ladder, and Cherry Canyon Trail. Expect lots of two-way traffic with runners, hikers, dog walkers, and mountain bikers; courtesy goes a long way here.

The full 16-mile hike (or backpack) between the Chamberlain's Ranch and Temple of Sinawava Trailheads can be done in a long day but is more comfortably done in two days. You'll be walking in the river for most of this route. The river's cold water and the rounded, submerged river rocks in its bed make for tiring and challenging footing.

From the trailhead, the trail dips down into the old wash and continues a while through loose gravel on a pretty gradual incline until, after about another 3/4 mile you reach a fork in the canyon. Take the left fork instead of going straight (there is a pretty obvious cairn and even an arrow on the ground made of rocks showing the way into the right canyon) and follow this wash that has a distinct trail most of the way through it (and if you lose the trail, the wash is still very easy to follow). As you make your way through the wash, the elevation gain is very gradual and manageable, and the route is made even better by the spectacular cliffs, rock formations, and foliage that can be seen. We were able to see flowering cacti and lots of greenery in spite of the trail being in the desert. 

As the trail gets closer to the head of the canyon, it goes over a few small rock steps that require some easy scrambling and eventually it reaches the top of the wash, where the route to the top leaves the wash and climbs up a steep ridge to get to the saddle just below Notch Peak. The summit is obviously to the left (west) of this saddle, and from this point you just take whatever route seems easiest to get to the top, where you can enjoy amazing views down into the canyon below (over 2000 feet below), and all around as well. Great Basin National Park's great peaks can be seen, as well as Sevier Lake (if there is water in it), and the many surrounding mountain ranges.

A couple of miles after that there is a spring/bog that looks like its coming out of the bottom of the tree. There is another little creek from a natural spring that you'll cross using a log. About 5 miles into the hike you'll cross over the Proctor Canyon FS road and continue north up a steep stretch.

The steepest up and down section of the trail is between Proctor and the Johnson Canyon. There is a little spot just before the Johnson Canyon Jct where you'll come on to an old pole fence and trough. Make sure you follow the trail to the west. Don't hike over the fence to the north. That is the wrong way.  There are FS signs at the Johnson Canyon Jct, so stay right on to the trail to Red Canyon.

Note that the round trip from the Cove Wash Trailhead and back is about 13.2 miles. From the top of Sidewinder Trail, Suicidal Tendencies immediately drops down a steep slope with exposed switchbacks. You should expect a steep descent, filled with switchbacks and precipitous exposure.  After you navigate down the edge of Sidewinder Mesa, youll wind across the valley floor before ascending up the next mesa.

The ascent is similar in technicality to the previous descent, a few technical rock sections with some exposure. Near the top of the climb is Hangover, a large rock that hangs above the trail.  Watch your head. Past the Hangover is a technical rock move nicknamed Thread the Needle, because you must fit between rocks on each side of the trail.  After this section, youve reached the top of the Mesa.

Once on top of the mesa, the hiking changes dramatically. The technicality drops significantly and you simply follow gentle switchbacks to the high point of the mesa. Here you are rewarded with views of the Beaver Dam Mountains to the west. Continuing on after the point, you descend through Juniper trees and occasional slick rock sections to complete the loop back to the top of Thread the Needle.

This description will describe the route in its entirety from the split from the White Pinel- Bunchgrass Canyon Trail to its end at the Boss Canyon Trail (where the trail on the ridge turns into the North Fork High Creek Trail).

From the White Pine-Bunchgrass Canyon Trail, the Doubletop Trail splits off (about 1.5 miles up the canyon from the White Pine Canyon Trail junction) and crosses the creek to the north side of the canyon. From here the trail starts to very gradually ascend through the sagebrush meadows, roughly paralleling the creek. There are plenty of cattle trails in this area, so make sure you're on the main trail. A little over half a mile from the trail junction, another spur trail can be seen going off to the right with a sign for the Shorty's Cutoff Trail, which leads over to the Steam Mill Canyon Trail, and eventually all the way over to the Steep Hollow Road FR 289. 

After this trail junction, the trail starts to ascend a little bit more steeply and starts to head toward the northern wall of the canyon. As it nears the ridge, the trail switches back once and then roughly follows a drainage up to the ridge top. Then the trail heads north and passes by Pika Peak (the unofficially named peak just to the east as you get to the top of the ridge) and continues, dipping down and back up again as it heads towards Doubletop Mountain. Soon the trail passes a junction with the Steam Mill Canyon Trail and continues north along the ridge. The trail can be indistinct in places, but generally follows the ridge and occasionally drops down behind a small peak to avoid the elevation gain. 

Although the views of Doubletop from the south aren't as impressive as from Steep Hollow or other places, it is still an incredible mountain and one of the most impressive in the Bear River Range. Eventually, the trail passes just below the South Summit and drops down into the notch between the two summits and passes back around the west side of the North summit.

It is worth it to summit both, as each offers a different view of the area, and the north peak is an especially fun scramble. After passing Doubletop, the trail becomes even more indistinct in places but goes north along the ridge until it meets up with the Boss Canyon Trail and North Fork High Creek Canyon Trails, just above Boss Canyon.

UPS starts at a juntion with the Kokopelli route on the right shortly after a cattle guard; it's well signed.

UPS is the kind of trail where things get really good, really fast.  After the short climb to the rim from the trail junction, you'll be overlooking Castle Valley.  From here, the trail begins connecting short bits of wavy slickrock.  The frequency of rock depends on how close you get to the rim.  The closer you are, the more slickrock there is to enjoy.  

After going along for a bit, you'll get to large slickrock.  The trail is to the right, but there are multiple ways to get down.  

The steep slick rock area will lead to Malloy Park and the Porcupine Rim Camping Area.  The trail braids here a bit, but keep heading north along the rim and you'll get back on track.  Afterwards, a little more smooth trail and slickrock will connect you with LPS.

This area is popular with mountain bikers, so be alert and respectful of other trail users.

LPS gets a little closer to the rim of the canyon (if you can imagine) so its a good idea to pay attention while hiking this trail.  The ledges and the occasional large step down make this trail a bit challenging.

0.7,Point to Point,4707,4231,0,475,14,40,Killer Bee Trail,Very Difficult,5.0,"        Killer Bee Trail is a rough and rugged finish to hiking the Bar M trails. Located at the southern end of the Bar M network. The trail is most certainly advanced; be prepared for constant and steep descending over loose trail and slickrock.

Starting at an intersection with Bar-B and Long Branch, Killer Bee starts by rounding the top of a hill and the descending very steeply down an old road bed. The slope is pretty much straight down with no changes in grade.

From here you'll head through a rocky gate and continue your near-vertical descent, this time on slickrock. If you haven't lowered your saddle by now, it might be wise to take a moment to do so.

At the bottom you'll roll into another intersection, the finale of Killer Bee Trail. Stay right for a segment that has tight switchbacks and some narrow and exposed trail. Stay left for a gnarly section. Both of these sections funnel into the Moab Canyon Paved Path.

Starting at the lower part of Donkey Flats Rd, the route climbs smooth singletrack to the north, up a small ridge. As the route turns east, it flattens out briefly and passes through an intersection with the HBC Connector. 

Continue straight here through terrain that features red dirt singletrack and twisted pinion trees. There is a short and somewhat steep climb toward a big sandstone mesa. The trail winds through here, following the edges of a hillside. 

This part of the route tops out at a small saddle and begins a descent to the southwest. This part of the trail has some sections of slickrock and a few minor drops. The corridor of trees and shrubs are also tighter through here.

Continue straight through the intersection with HBC and drop down a rock ledge by a small tree. From here the trail wraps around the bottom of the big sandstone mesa and then drops into a large slick rock drainage.

As J-Boy Trail crosses the upper part of Donkey Flats Rd, it climbs again to gain a long, exposed rock cliff. The trail through here is right on the edge, with expansive views of the Red Fleet trail area. 

Near the end point of the cliff, the trail turns sharply left and begins a rough and technical descent, the most difficult in the entire system.

The challenge begins with a chunky larger step down between a giant cliff and a car-sized boulder. From there, the trail snakes through a couple of tight turns around more boulders. The spiciness continues with a long, rock armored causeway that transitions into more tight switchbacks.

The bottom end of J-Boy rambles out to a t-intersection with HBC.

1.7,Point to Point,5983,5689,184,303,5,19,Handsome Cabin Boy Trail (HCB),Difficult,5.0,"        HCB is a good trail for experiencing all that Red Fleet has to offer, combining the technical challenge of slickrock with the playfulness of smooth singletrack.

HCB starts on the east side of Donkey Flats Rd at an intersection with J-Boy Trail. Heading south, the route ducks and dives around pinion trees and juniper shrubs over hard-packed singletrack and slickrock. There are a couple of short steep sections before coasting across the road.

On the other side, HCB continues over slickrock along the edge of a rim overlooking the lower reaches of the Red Fleet trail network. This part of the route is mostly level with some minor undulations.

After passing the intersection with the lower end of J-Boy, HCB starts a fun and somewhat steep at times, descent over more slickrock. The views towards the sandstone canyons are awesome through here.

The last bit of the descent is on a slippery hill which feeds out onto the bottom of a dry wash.

In any case, this spur follows a good trail for a ways and then leaves you to make your own way up and out of the canyon. Make note of landmarks for the return. When you get nearer to Session's Mountain Road, find the ""Holbrook Canyon Trail"" sign out in the middle of the field. It's funny to me, because you can't see a trail anywhere near it.

Most people do it as a short out-and-back before continuing to the observation point parking area. The trail actually continues on, however, and drops to meet Carmel Canyon Loop. This makes some various loop hiking options or an alternative way to start toward Goblin's Lair Trail.

13.3,Point to Point,6129,3800,327,2656,4,52,Slickhorn Canyon,Intermediate,5.0,"        This route follows the headwaters draw of Slickhorn canyon all the way to the canyon proper. From the parking lot, follow the wash southwest, passing through thickets of tamarisk and rabbitbrush. The wash soon opens up affording you a gently descending hike over slickrock. The draw gradually develops into a larger canyon. You hit a smaller pour-off at about 0.7 miles that is easy to bypass on the left. A much bigger pour-off is ahead of you at around 1.7 miles. You can see into Slickhorn Canyon far below you with slickrock walls about 300 to 400 feet tall.

The way around the pour-off is on the left, a path rises up the ledge a few yards before the pour-off. From there, follow the rim on an overhanging cliff rewarding you with spectacular views of the first bend of Slickhorn Canyon. At about 2 miles, follow the cairns leading you down into the canyon over a series of ledges and overhanging cliffs. The path switches back and forth but is well marked with cairns. Once you reach the bottom of the canyon, turn left and proceed downcanyon through the wash.

The wash can be narrow at times, but is typically easy to navigate with some boulder hopping along the way. Not before long, you'll also see small trails following the wooded benches which makes walking a little easier. At 3.8 miles, a balanced rock high on the canyon wall marks the confluence with the second fork. Continue further for another 0.4 miles to reach the third fork.

I did not travel beyond 3.8 miles but the trail continues to the river.

Spurring from the Indian Trail, this marches up above the cliffs and then winds its way into, well, a hidden valley. The main destination, at the time of this writer's memory, is marked with massive cairns near Taylor Canyon that must have taken quite some time to build.  

From here, go back the way you came or continue on the trail as it descends, a bit steeply at times, into Taylor Canyon and links up with the Taylor Canyon Trail. You could then take the Bonneville Shoreline Trail back to the Indian Trail to make a complete loop.

21.4,Point to Point,9642,4993,7630,3676,10,45,Skyline Trail,Difficult,4.5,"        The Skyline Trail is one of the most heavily used trails in the Ogden area. The northern portion is very popular among hikers, mountain bikers, equestrians, and motorcyclists, especially on weekends and holidays.

Local flora and fauna highlight the route. The trail provides spectacular views of the Ogden area, from Willard to Antelope Island. It is an outstanding area to view wildflowers and fall colors. The area offers some of the world's oldest geologic formations. Willard and Ben Lomond Peaks are part of the Wasatch Fault, and many fault lines run through the area. 

The shorelines of ancient Lake Bonneville can easily be seen from a distance. The higher bench is known as the Bonneville Terrace and the lower bench is called the Provo Terrace. If you are observant at the higher elevations, you may see mountain goats roaming from Willard Peak to Ben Lomond. These animals have been successfully re-introduced into their native habitat. 

The west flank of Willard Peak was the site of an iron mine opened in 1873 by Israel Elliott Brown. The company was dissolved when the smelting furnace blew up. A few of the remains may still be seen. The 12 miles of the southern Skyline portion of the trail is heavily used on weekends and holidays but not during the week. A side trail leads to Lewis Peak which is lesser in stature compared to the rugged Ben Lomond Peak, but the climb is just as exhaustive. 

During mid-summer, you'll want to get an early start as the trail's southern exposure and scant forest coverage can make for a warm climb. The trail begins with a steep incline and switchbacks take you from overlooks of Pineview Reservoir to Ogden Canyon's limestone formations. 

About 2.0 miles from Pineview is a very short spur to the right and leads to Lookout Point. At mile 3.0 there are outstanding views of farm and ranch lands in Ogden Valley. The trail curves northeasterly into thick foliage offering some comforting shade. Near mile 5, the trail crosses between Goodall Canyon above Ogden Canyon and the head of Nordic Valley Ski Area. 

The trail to Lewis Peak (8,031 feet) is 2.5 miles one-way from the Skyline Trail and is well worth the effort. Return back to the Pineview Trailhead or alternately follow the ridge north toward North Ogden Pass. It is 5.3 miles along the ridge line northward then down to North Ogden Pass. Park a vehicle at North Ogden Divide Trailhead if you're not do not plan to hike 9.5 miles back to Pineview Trailhead.

6.2,Point to Point,7148,5232,1931,15,6,14,Mueller Park Trail,Intermediate,4.3,"        From the parking lot and trailhead, the trail crosses a sturdy footbridge and then ascends via multiple switchbacks through mature forests and ferns. The first couple of miles will often be crowded with families completing the Elephant Rock Out and Back.  

Further up the trail, the crowds thin and the occasional mountain biker or hiker will cross your path.  Roughly 3.5 miles up the trail, a beautiful view of the valley is possible from the top of Elephant Rock.  

Those continuing on past Elephant Rock will enjoy dense evergreen forests with gentle ascents on the way to Rudy's Flat. This portion of the trail is far more lonely as few who are on foot travel this far. At Rudy's Flat, a beautiful alpine meadow with wildflowers can be enjoyed where you can continue a little ways to the south to see views of Salt Lake City or a little ways to the northwest and see expansive views of Bountiful and the Great Salt Lake. 

Rudy's Flat is sometimes inhabited by Boy Scouts camping. The trail continues by connecting to North Canyon Trail, or hikers can return the way that they came.

6.1,Point to Point,8690,5762,2938,9,9,21,Ben Lomond Trail,Intermediate,4.8,"        The Ben Lomond Trail is a great way to get to Ben Lomond Peak. It is a gradual 6-mile climb to the saddle. You'll probably see a moose or two.

If climbing the trail as mapped, start at the North Fork Park's southwestern most parking lot, hike left going northwest past the corral. Continue on singletrack through the trees, then after a few hundred yards, merge onto a doubletrack trail. 

Continue on the dirt road until you see singletrack on the right side. Head onto the singletrack to keep climbing through more trees with major roots, rocks, and several switchbacks. The top of the trail ends at a ""T"" intersection. Left follows the Skyline Trail south for a nice descent with some exposed edges and tricky ruts. Heading right would continue up the Skyline Trail along a series of very steep switchbacks to the Ben Lomond Peak.

During the summer months, it can get really dusty and loose. And when you hit the trees heading back down, expect some roots to navigate. The rest of the singletrack back to the parking lot is a nice, smooth, and shady hike through the trees.

5.6,Point to Point,9013,6024,3096,107,11,44,South Fork High Creek Canyon,Intermediate/Difficult,4.7,"        From the trailhead, cross the first bridge across High Creek, and then continue on past the remnants of the bridge that failed (about a quarter of a mile or less from the trailhead). You'll continue on the south side of the canyon for another half mile until you reach the first (and most difficult) stream crossing. The trail continues and slowly ascends up to a point where the old trail crosses the creek where it is pretty wide - do not cross here, because there is nothing on the other side, and the trail actually continues up to the left for a short distance and then crosses the stream where it is smaller and has an actual bridge over it. 

After this crossing, you'll continue up through forests and brushy areas and encounter several other stream crossings until you reach a section where things level out for a little bit as you pass several beaver ponds. From here, you'll be able to see the north face of Cherry Peak, an impressive set of cliffs. As you ascend the trail you'll get closer and closer to Cherry Peak, and then the trail will turn left and start inclining more steeply. About a tenth of a mile from this point where the trail starts going east, there is an overlook to a very pretty waterfall, about 20 feet tall. 

Once you get back on the trail, it continues switchbacking up and steepening but the views keep getting better and better as you start to see the head of a glacially carved valley filled with wildflowers (in season). The trail continues up until you reach the glacial moraine that dams High Creek Lake's outlet and from here you can see the headwall of this spectacular cirque that envelops High Creek Lake. The trail from here steepens even more as you get to the junction of this trail with the Cherry Creek Trail, but it's only about a half mile to get there from High Creek Lake.

Posey Canyon Trail immediately takes you steeply uphill to the northwest. 

Described by one of my hiking partners as ""improbable,"" this trail is very cool. It winds very steeply uphill with awesome views along the way. For its duration, you'll be able to see the Abajo's to the north, the San Juan's to the east, Black Mountain and Ute Peak to the southeast, and the Carrizo Mountains to the south. Not only are the mountain views expansive, you'll have excellent views looking into Posey Canyon.

5.7,Point to Point,5686,4214,80,1531,5,54,Alcove Spring Trail,Difficult,4.8,"        The first steep, 1.5-mile descent is a wild, rocky, and sometimes hard-to-follow trail. After dropping approximately 1000 feet, the trail flattens out as you hike along a winding path through a field with grand views as the canyon widens for about a mile. The trail then takes you into a dry, sandy/loose gravel river bed which you'll follow until you meet up with the Moses & Zeus Trail. The trail ends near the Taylor Campground (complete with a bathroom). At this point, you can either turn back or take the short and well-worth it Moses & Zeus Trail, which offers amazing views of the spires. 

The majority of the hike takes place in the river bed as you meander through the canyon. If you are doing an out and back, the climb back to the car is challenging but manageable. There are points when you'll be scrabbling on the rocks, as most of the elevation change is within the first two miles of the trail. This trail has spectacular views of the canyon and Moses & Zeus spires, and is a rewarding 13-mile round-trip trek (if you include the Moses & Zeus Trail).

1.4,Point to Point,6993,5667,1331,5,18,96,Jardine Juniper from Cottonwood Canyon,Difficult,4.8,"        The bottom portion of this trail has been recently renovated (summer of 2015) and is in great shape, with long switchbacks and low grades that make progress very easy. To get to this trail, you'll need to park at the unmarked Cottonwood Canyon trailhead and go up Cottonwood Canyon for about a quarter of a mile where you'll see a fork in the trailhead going off to the left.

From the fork that leaves the Cottonwood Canyon trail, the trail ascends through the forest that covers the bottom of Cottonwood Canyon and crosses some fallen trees (that have been notched to make them easier to get across) and eventually leaves the forest for a rockier, more exposed patch. 

Once the trail reaches this point, it starts to ascend ever more steeply until you reach portions that require scrambling. This portion of the trail was not renovated in the recent work, which means it is a little less distinct, but still not very hard to find. After some steep climbing, it reaches another small set of steep switchbacks that lead right up to the old juniper, along with a small overlook and benches and a sign with information about the amazing tree.

There are both coniferous and deciduous trees throughout the hiking experience.  The trail is a gradual ascent that weaves around a stream that is always running. You'll cross half log bridges that criss-cross over the stream all along the hike. 

The trail ends at a cavernous area with a respectable waterfall, approximately 25 feet high. The flow of the waterfall depends on the time of year, but you can always expect a picturesque scene. There is a trail that leads to the top of the waterfall but it is quite steep and appears to be more of a game trail that follows the stream.  The water depth at the bottom of the waterfall can fluctuate from a few inches to a couple of feet, so be prepared!

In Big Water, turn north on Ethan Allan, which is across the road from the Big Water Visitor Center. Take Ethan Allan until it intersects with Fish Hatchery Rd. Turn left and continue past the hatchery.  About three miles from the highway, you'll come to a creek crossing. Depending on the water level, you may or may not have a problem crossing this with a two-wheel drive vehicle. If in doubt, park and start the hike from here.  Otherwise, the official two-wheel drive parking area is about 0.3 miles farther. Do not continue up the road from there. It goes up a different canyon and is for four-wheel drive vehicles only. 

There is no real trail. You simply make your way up Wahweap Creek, which is very wide and almost flat. It is easiest if you avoid soft sand and look for hard mud or rocky soil. The exact best path will vary from year to year.

The colorful canyon walls become higher and more interesting as you proceed up the creek. At a little less than three miles, you come to a towering buttress on the left that is capped with hard rock.The first group of tall toadstools and hoodoos are beneath it, against the cliffs.  

A second and more interesting group is about one mile farther upstream. For this, a picture is worth more than anything I can say. Be careful where you place your feet, because the white rock is very soft and easily damaged. Take time to explore around. Some of the best hoodoos are not immediately visible.  

There is currently no direct path through the dense tamarisk between the second and third groups. Instead, return to the stream bed and approach the third group from the northeast. Again, take your time to explore the area, but avoid damaging the soft white rock.

From here, the trail follows the south bank of the Fremont River along a flat stretch with orchards and a pasture on the left and dense riparian vegetation to the right. After passing through an opening in a fence, the path ascends somewhat steeply along a Moenkopi cliff to a point with a good view west into the Fremont Gorge. Turning south, the trail soon climbs gently to a good ridge-top viewpoint.

The ridge-top offers a fine panorama of the park from the north around to the east and south. Almost due north, the small, rounded, three segment block of the Navajo Knobs tops the Fruita Cliffs that rise above Johnson Mesa. Looking farther right (east), the domes and fins of the Navajo Sandstone that rise above the Fremont River stand out, especially in evening light, with the campground and orchards below. The V-shaped entrance to Cohab Canyon is just left of a beautiful exposure of, from the bottom, the Moenkopi, Chinle and Wingate Formations. Ferns Nipple and more Wingate cliffs march off to the south, while the gentle slope of Miners Mountain is the backdrop to the west. From this lofty perch, it is easy to see that the area’s rock layers are slanted downward not directly east, but more to the northeast. The view is right into the heart of the Waterpocket Fold.

3.5,Point to Point,5927,4741,915,1202,12,28,Indian Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.5,"        Two options of starting points: Starting mid-way up Ogden Canyon, this trail can be accessed via a side-canyon (Coldwater Canyon Trail) north of Ogden Peak. The trail then traverses the south side of Ogden Canyon until it reaches the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. 
Or some start at the 22nd street trailhead in Ogden and follow signage heading east to the shack at the top of the trail and then turn around and return. This trail can also be done car-to-car.

Along the way, there are a few tricky sections—washouts, some re-enforced with retaining walls, some not, some with broken retaining walls. A fun lookout with a wood weather shack at the top makes for a great rest area or photo op. Try to prevent erosion whenever and wherever you can. If you're lucky you may catch a glimpse of the local military jets flying by at eye level.

1.6,Point to Point,5788,5360,338,430,9,30,Cohab Canyon Trail,Intermediate,4.1,"        Beginning at the Scenic Drive, the trail climbs steep switchbacks to a river-sculpted terrace below the Wingate Cliff. After a short ascent, the path enters the canyon and drops quickly to the sandy floor. Side canyons and abundant vegetation add to the beauty of the red rock walls. As Cohab Canyon widens, the route traverses slickrock down to a junction with the trail that leads to the viewpoints high above on the north and south sides. These spur trails are well worth your time; views over the Fruita Historic District are especially gorgeous in the fall. Most people turn around after spending time at the overlooks by backtracking and descending the trail back down to their car.

If you decide to continue hiking on top of the mesa, a junction with the Frying Pan Trail follows, which allows you to connect to the Cassidy Arch spur trail.  Otherwise, the path stays high above the deepening canyon and eventually descends to Highway 24, just east of the Hickman Bridge trailhead. You would need a shuttle vehicle parked here to get you back to the trailhead.

4.4,Point to Point,6797,5627,1177,278,6,32,East Mesa Trail,Intermediate,4.1,"        This somewhat unremarkable trail takes you from Zion's east mesa to East Rim Trail, snaking its way through dense forest as it goes. Though not a sought after hike compared to the other trails around it, East Mesa does provide great views of the Pink Cliffs and Brian Head Peak (11,306'). Additionally, you'll get great views of Bulloch Gulch to the north, its surrounding canyon, and have access to one of the best views in the park from Observation Point Trail.

Starting from East Rim Trail, East Mesa climbs very steeply, switchbacking multiple times until it eventually contours south of a small mesa. Once the trail levels off, all of the hard stuff is done. Hike a short ways north and you'll pass Observation Point Trail on your left. Be sure not to miss this must-see trail as it's a short connector leading to some of the best views in Zion.

Once past Observation Point Trail, follow East Mesa east as it winds its way down the park's eastern mesa at an easy grade. Eventually you'll connect with Fir Rd., a dirt road just to the east of the park.

Much of the trail is on a ridge, but there are some steep and rocky switchbacks. The trail is challenging and rugged at times, offering amazing views of the Mount Nebo Wilderness. The trail leads to North Peak and then drops down into Wolf Pass where a non-maintained trail leads to the summit of Mount Nebo at 11,928 elevation. The climb from Wolf Pass to the summit is a rocky scramble along a narrow ridge. North Peak Trail is the shortest trail to the top of Mount Nebo.

The trail starts off on a nice sandy section and leads up to some slickrock. Once on the slickrock, follow the cairns. The trails are marked very well at every intersection with signs. 

The trail winds around on several rim sections. A ladder will lead you down one of the steep slickrock sections, and you can continue on a small rim. The trail then leads you down into a awesome wash with trees and sand. This part of the trail will take you by a backpacking campsite. 

Continue on out of the wash back up on to the rim where you'll weave around the huge areas of slickrock and huge walls. Just the follow the cairns. At one point, you go through a small hole in the wall to lead you onto the next section. This trails has some small steep climbs and descents. 

You finally come to a flatter area with a big canyon on your right; keep your eye on the cairns and follow them to a ladder that goes down into a crack. Go down the ladder into the canyon where you'll find a flat, sandy trail leading you to the other side of the trailhead where you find some rock art on the wall. 

On the way back, just follow your steps back to the trailhead. Make sure you have plenty of water since there is no water on the trail.

1.8,Point to Point,6126,5546,674,94,8,31,Golden Throne Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.4,"        At the start, the trail climbs moderately, and the road soon seems far below. In a short distance, mostly natural steps lead up to a section that winds through large, iron-stained sandstone boulders that have fallen from above. A long flat stretch begins as the trail circumvents a deeply incised side drainage, the first of four encountered along the way. After a short climb, the second flat begins, and the pattern continues.

The next ascent highlights the variable conditions under which the sandstone and siltstones of the Kayenta Formation were deposited. Keep an eye on and around the trail for variety of sandstone examples.

As the next flat begins, the Golden Throne comes into view for the first time, nicely framed by vegetation and the right-hand cliff wall. From the switchbacks that follow, the view east is consumed by a sheer wall of nicely cross-bedded Navajo Sandstone. The next flat is richly endowed with thick biological soil crust that brightens with blossoms as early as late March. In this section, please keep on the trail. Cryptobiotic soil is incredibly fragile, and the damage caused by single footprints can take decades to heal. 

The fourth flat ends in a short slickrock grade marked by several cairns. Here the Navajo sandstone wall off to the right bears a shallow dome-shaped amphitheater. The acoustics are such that even moderately heavy footfalls can be heard echoing back from the wall, and normal conversation bounces back without significant loss of volume. The wall, appropriately, is known as the ""echo wall.""

A short way beyond the echo wall, the trail leaves the lee of the cliffs on the right and ascends a small hill topped by a sign that states succinctly “Trail’s End.” From this vantage point, the Golden Throne thrusts up high in the northeast, though some of its base is obscured. To the east, the Henry Mountains are visible through a gap, and in springtime they will often be snow-covered and handsome.

Hiking time to the Golden Throne will be relatively short, and this is a great route if you're limited on time but want to take in some of the highlights of Capitol Reef. Your journey will be a little quicker on the return, as you'll be descending instead of heading up.

2.1,Point to Point,5149,3966,73,1256,12,61,Honaker Trail,Difficult,4.6,"        It's hard to believe there is a way down to the San Juan River in this area. But back in 1893, Henry Honaker constructed a trail as a supply route for gold prospectors. The gold mining didn't pan out (pun intended) and legend has it that Honaker only collected enough gold to make a wedding ring for his wife.

Hiking up the Honaker Trail is a classic San Juan River rafting activity, though many groups will turn around at Horn Point after about 1.3 miles, when the trail reaches a rock outcrop almost directly above the starting point below, rather than climb the entire 1200 ft.

From the parking area on the rim above, the descent and climb back out aren't difficult per se, but they do follow steady grades. However, your effort is rewarded constantly by fantastic views and an often-beguiling interaction of light and water.

For a detailed trip report of hiking the Honaker Trail, read Rich Holtzin's Honaker Trail guide.

6.6,Point to Point,5877,5485,598,990,5,20,Lower Death Hollow,Difficult,4.7,"        This trail follows a river all the way to its junction with the Escalante River with great sandstone views the entire time. It's pleasingly green along the river much of the way, and the aspens are a glorious yellow when hiking in the fall (e.g. early October). The canyon is wide enough that it allows plenty of sunlight while often avoiding direct sunlight.

The trail is not marked but it is easy to follow and there is nowhere to get lost except up the occasional side canyon. There are dozen of river crossing so be prepared to get wet up to your knees. I did okay with the combination of waterproof hiking boot and waterproof knee high socks; my companion just wore waterproof toe socks that gave him good traction and didn't hurt his feet because the trail is mostly sand and riverbed rocks are small. Sometimes it is easiest to just navigate in the river, particularly towards the end of the canyon, near the confluence.

Flash floods are possible in this area, so this trip should be postponed if rain is likely. However, this is not a slot canyon per se. If you are caught by a flash flood, you should have time to scramble to location two or three meters above the river and set up camp.

I suggest wearing a hat, mostly to prevent getting your head scratched by low branches.

This route is almost always done one way and as part of a larger loop. For a fee, you can arrange a shuttle in the town of Escalante, in which you can have your car moved from the start of the Boulder Mail Trail to the junction of the Escalante River and Highway 12. Escalante Outfitters is a good place to make inquiries, check recent conditions (mid-May through mid-June spring runoff can boost river flow), and buy topo maps (though GPS works pretty well along this route despite being down in a canyon).

2.6,Point to Point,6063,5715,377,261,5,32,Skull Crack Trail,Intermediate,4.6,"        From the trailhead at the southern end of Causey Reservoir, this trail gradually ascends, paralleling the shore of the reservoir. The trail quickly gains access to great views of the reservoir, as well as the surrounding mountains. 

As the trail turns a corner and heads to the east, it starts to gain most of its actual elevation and quickly allows for some great views of the cliffs on the opposite side of the reservoir. The trail weaves in and out of several drainages, going past beautiful wild flowers (during the right season) and eventually drops down to where the Right Fork South Fork of the Ogden River runs into Causey Reservoir. 

This is one of the best trails for getting good views of the most beautiful parts of Causey Reservoir, and you can usually see lots of kayakers and cliff jumpers in the water as you go along this beautiful trail.

6.1,Point to Point,9375,5847,3603,431,13,40,Cherry Creek Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.6,"        From the trailhead start up the canyon, pass through some woods where you'll start to parallel Cherry Creek. As the trail continues, you'll cross the creek a few times as you weave in and out of the forest canopy. Eventually, you'll rise out of the forest canopy altogether and start climbing more steadily on small switchbacks. At about 2.5 miles from the trailhead, there is an opportunity to see a waterfall if you take a small side trail (off to the right, at just under 7800 feet of elevation). 

From this point, you continue up and out of the vegetated part of the canyon and start to get to the rockier portion of the huge switchback that makes up most of this trail. You'll continue up from this for another mile until you reach a large meadow which is where the switchback turns to the northeast and ascends the last few hundred feet to a saddle (at about 9400 feet of elevation) and a wide ridge with great views of Cherry Peak, Mount Naomi, and the surrounding canyons, as well as a good portion of Cache Valley. From here, the trail descends slightly until you reach the base of Cherry Peak (here is a great opportunity to summit with some easy scrambling) and then descend again until you reach the junction of the Cherry Creek Trail with the High Creek Canyon Trail, as well as the Mount Naomi NRT.

0.6,Loop,4977,4913,64,70,4,11,Cave Spring Trail,Intermediate,4.6,"        You'll want to take this loop trail clockwise to eventually climb up the two sets of ladders here, unless you're better at descending them. At first, it's a sandy singletrack trail through Sagebrush, Greasewood, Rabbit Bush, Skunk Bush and other desert vegetation. In 700 feet, you'll see the old cowboy camp beneath the sandstone ledge on your right. Shortly after, you'll see a wooden oat bin, then a small cave containing the Cave Spring. Notice the moss and vegetation where the water drips out. The trail leaves the overhang for another open brush area where sweet smelling Alyssum abound. The trail heads back under the ledges. After 1/4 mile, you'll reach the first ladder with 11 rungs. There's a large step where you get off the ladder, so be careful. 

Immediately after is a ladder with seven rungs that leads you to a slickrock path. Follow the cairns as the trail bears to the right. You'll soon see the famous Needles formation far off to the south. Continue on to see flowers and prickly pear cactus shaded by the pine trees. Continue on the slickrock and be sure to follow the cairns. At the halfway point, you can look back at the trailhead from atop the sandstone bluff. Although the loose soil may look like an easier path, stay on the path to preserve the cryptobiotic soil. 

Begin a gradual descent as the trail switches back. Be sure of foot as part of the slickrock track is at an 18° slope. You'll soon ascend off the slickrock into a sandy singletrack trail that is bordered by Alyssum and scrub brush. The trail follows under a sandstone ledge. You'll return where you started, but come back changed.

1.1,Point to Point,5265,4746,520,0,9,60,Hidden Canyon Trail,Difficult,4.6,"        The Hidden Canyon Trail traverses a cliff face to the mouth of a narrow canyon. It is physically strenuous due to the steep grades, and mentally challenging due to the dizzying height. As you ascend, the steepness of the trail lessens, but the difficulty remains high due to the extreme exposure. Utilize the chains that have been bolted to the cliff in order to stabilize your body and your mind. 

Keep following the trail to the mouth of the canyon and its terminus. From here, one can hike and scramble further into the hanging canyon, but the official trail ends.

To the south there is a huge boulder field. The trail starts to get a bit more difficult to follow and the grade becomes very steep. The grade remains steep until you reach Upper Red Pine Lake. 

Here the trail flattens out for about a 100 yards until you reach the next section that leads to a saddle. Once the ridgeline is reached, the trail becomes a scramble over and around large boulders until you reach the final steep section which heads straight up the side of the peak.

3.5,Point to Point,7751,5141,2609,0,14,30,Grove Creek Trail,Intermediate,4.5,"        This trail starts out with a smooth, wide dirt road-like section, but within about a half mile the trail turns into singletrack as it nears Grove Creek. It then hits a switchback that brings the trail up above the creek for about a mile. 

The section after the switchback is a cool section of the trail, where you can see a couple of neat waterfalls and a section of the trail appears to have been carved out of a cliff band. After about a mile of being up above the creek, the trail eventually meets up with the creek and crosses over it via a small foot bridge. 

After crossing the foot bridge, the trail switches back a couple more times and pretty soon starts to level out as it ascends into the meadow below Mount Timpanogos. The trail passes by a sign for Indian Campground and Grove Creek Spring, and there is a spring nearby (right next to the trail) that can be used if you need a water refill. 

After the spring, the trail continues past a few forks in the trail, including a fork that goes to the south on the Grove Creek - GWT Connector, another that goes north towards Mahogany Mountain, and a fork (where you can go either north or south) with the Great Western Trail. Not long after the fork with the Great Western Trail, the trail ends at the Timpooneke Road.

6.3,Point to Point,9510,6692,2894,77,9,26,Steam Mill Canyon Trail,Intermediate,4.7,"        From the trailhead, the route is initially well signed. In the fall, unfortunately, the beginning of the trail from the parking area is really tracked out by cattle and horses, and there's a massive puddle (at least there was when I went) that you need to cross to get over to the trail (or, if you look about 100 feet to the right of this puddle, there is a small trail and a pallet bridge over the small creek that you can use to avoid the pond).

After crossing this small creek, the trail immediately starts to ascend through a rocky forest. Elk seem to like this area and can often be heard or seen near the trail along this bottom portion as the trail ascends up and into the glacial valley. After reaching the actual valley (about 1.75 miles from the trailhead), the trail becomes significantly less steep and much more manageable as the trail heads towards the lake and the head of the cirque.

There are a couple of stream crossings along this trail, and after about another 3-3.5 miles from the trailhead, the trail crosses the creek and meets up with the Shorty's Cutoff Trail, and right around this same spot are the remnants of the old steam mill that is the canyon's namesake. This section is very pretty, especially in the spring and early summer when the wildflowers are in bloom. It's also pretty in the fall as there are plenty of aspens and other deciduous trees mixed in with the conifers, that add lots of color to the area.

After passing the steam mill, about a mile later, the trail passes by Steam Mill Lake, a small glacial tarn with a moderately developed cirque headwall behind it. The trail at this point becomes braided in spots and often becomes indistinct as it gets closer to the main headwall of the canyon on the far west side below the ridge and the Doubletop Trail. Once the trail passes Steam Mill Lake, it again becomes somewhat indistinct, and there are actually two options for getting to the ridge from here - there is another indistinct trail that switches back to the northeast and then follows the ridge along the north side of Steam Mill Canyon back to the west to get to the ridge and the Doubletop Trail. This is the option shown on the map. The other option is to just go straight through the main basin at the head of the canyon and find a steep horse trail that switches back up the gully that leads directly to the Doubletop Trail atop the ridge, where this trail terminates.

It's sandy in a few short sections but mostly nice track otherwise. The trail can be done as an out-and-back, combined with Church Rocks, and/or Dino Cliffs for a longer lollypop loop, or one-way with a shuttle car.  This trail starts when you branch off of the Grapvine trail.

There are three trailheads that access this trail.

Go left at the first light onto Highland Parkway.  Follow Highland Parkway about one mile to the park.  There is no sign marking the trailhead at Highland Park, but it's easy to find. 

Leaving Highland Park, follow the paved road a short distance northeast as it wraps around the park until the pavement ends. Pass the large boulders blocking the end of the road, and hike on some old cement.  The singletrack starts just past the cement. After about a half mile, the singletrack turns into a doubletrack and passes east through a gate heading toward a large water tank. Before you reach the tank, take the old dirt road on your left (south). That road goes a short distance downhill to a large tunnel that takes you under the I-15 freeway.

This popular trail takes you down steep slickrock descends that can be challenging even for experienced hikers. The trail initially follows the rim of shallow Bullet Canyon and zigzags onto the canyon floor after 0.2 miles. From that point on, Bullet Canyon gradually grows deeper. At 1.4 miles you encounter several steep slickrock chutes that can be dangerous when wet. Follow the cairns on the right side. At the bottom of the chutes, the canyon walls are almost 600 feet high. The trail then mostly follows the wash, but also traverses a major slickrock ledge. After 3 miles, the trail becomes well defined and amazing amphitheaters open up on all sides offering premium scenery. Perfect Kiva, an ancient Anasazi ruin can be reached from a small side trail after about 4.5 miles. The trail then gets increasingly sandy and depending on the season you'll have to bushwhack your way through the thicket. There are several good camp sites at the confluence of Bullet Canyon and Grand Gulch.

0.6,Loop,9604,9582,39,40,2,13,Lower Red Pine Lake Loop,Intermediate,4.7,"        This short trail goes all the way around Lower Red Pine Lake, and provides access to several good camping spots around the lake. As it travels around the east side, the trail is well-defined and maintained and makes for easy hiking. As it goes around the south side, the trail narrows in places and splits off into different spur trails to camping areas and so becomes slightly harder to follow, but as long as you generally keep close to the lake you can't go wrong. 

The trail crosses the inlet of lower Red Pine Lake at the far southern end, and then enters a portion of the trail where it narrows and the vegetation grows thickly around it. At the southwest end, the trail somewhat disappears in a pile of large talus, but the trail can be seen on the other side, and the talus can be somewhat fun to jump across. 

After getting back on the trail, it winds through a small forest and then the trail opens up again as it reaches the dam at the northwest end of lower Red Pine Lake. It can be a fun balancing exercise to hike across the top of the concrete portion of the dam, or it is also easy to just hike on either side of the dam across to the trail on the other side. The trail then passes by another patch of camping areas, and then meets up with the original Red Pine Lake Trail again.

From here, you'll have great views of the North Guardian Angel, a large sandstone formation that juts up from the surrounding landscape. 

There are multiple trails heading up either of the Northgate Peaks if you're looking for a scramble to a better view. It should be noted that these approaches are not sanctioned park trails - please be considerate of your surroundings and stick to defined paths to avoid trampling delicate desert fauna.

2.6,Point to Point,5396,5147,477,235,5,24,Big Spring to Elephant Canyon Trail,Intermediate,4.5,"        You'll find this trail on your right/west just over a half mile along Big Spring Canyon Trail from the Squaw Flats parking area. When on a dirt surface, the trail is easy to follow, but when on solid rock, make sure you keep an eye out for cairns. 

At about a third of a mile, you'll leave the flat dirt to scramble onto the rocky walls separating Big Spring and Elephant Canyons. This first scramble is a great introduction to the fun that awaits throughout The Needles district (and is much more fun than difficult). Once on solid rock, follow the Martian landscape south and slightly uphill. 

After 1.3(ish) miles, you'll be at the top of the canyon walls and get to head back down into another branch of Big Spring Canyon. Follow the canyon floor west, and keep an eye out for a turn northwards. This is the beginning of a large bend in the trail that will take you up and out of the Big Spring Canyon branch. Expect a little more enjoyable scrambling as you ascend onto a plateau that leads to Devils Kitchen to Elephant Canyon Trail.

0.5,Point to Point,4544,4356,188,26,9,42,Upper Delicate Arch Viewpoint Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        This is the trail for you if you want good views of Delicate Arch, but don't want to hike the full 3 mile trail to the arch.  To access this trail, go to the parking lot at the very end of the Wolfe Ranch/Delicate Arch Road (drive past Wolfe Ranch - it's the Delicate Arch Trail trailhead for folks going to the base of the arch).

From the parking lot, take the initially paved trail east/northeast and follow the left fork when the trail branches.  The trail climbs gently at first over open desert scrub before paralleling a wash with larger bushes.  Surmount a steep, rocky outcrop using stairs and rock slabs.  After a sharp turn to the east, the grade eases considerably and the amble up tan slickrock slabs commences.  Turn back to the north following rock pile cairns up and over crevassed rock scattered with shrubs.  

The trail ends at the rim of a steep canyon that separates the viewpoint from the arch.  Pick your favorite vantage point- the cliff stretches for nearly half a mile to the east, giving many points from which to capture the perfect photograph.  You are only half a mile as the crow flies from the famous arch itself, just across the Winter Camp Wash down below.  

Note: there is no way to access the base of Delicate Arch from this viewpoint trail - to access the base, use Delicate Arch Trail from Wolfe Ranch instead.

The first half mile or so ascends gradually as the trail wraps around the ridge between Maybird Gulch and Red Pine Canyon. 

After this first half mile, the trail steepens as it starts to parallel the creek as it ascends toward the lakes. At this point, the trail narrows but stays distinguishable all the way up to the upper two Maybird Lakes. These lakes are small, but beautiful as they are surrounded by the gorgeous aretes that make up Maybird Gulch, and also have the magnificent Pfeifferhorn as a backdrop.

From Deertrap Mountain Trail, the trail rises slightly, then begins a slow descent to the edge of the canyon as it heads northwest. Almost a mirror image of the ascent you took to get to this point, the descent to the canyon's edge is a mellow hike ending in a populous pinyon-juniper forest.

The end of this trail plays host to quite a few wonders:
Views of Angel's LandingViews of The Great White Throne...and the historic Cable Mountain Draw Works 
The Cable Mountain Draw Works is an early 20th century aerial tramway that was used to move lumber and timber from the mesas of Cable Mountain to the floor of Zion Canyon. The structure was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The Draw Works was originally conceived and constructed by Springdale pioneer David Flanigan, who regarded the Draw Works as a fulfillment of an 1863 prophecy by Brigham Young that lumber would one day be transported from the canyon rim as the hawk flies. During operation of the Draw Works, from 1901 to 1927, the structure was used to move hundreds of thousands of board feet of lumber, goods, people occasionally, and a dog once, to the canyon floor 2,000 feet below.

Beyond Malans Peak (which is more of an overlook than a peak), you'll find Malans Basin where a hotel once stood. The long switchbacks to Malans Peak take you through a wonderful evergreen forest. From the basin, find the trail that continues east toward Ogden Saddle. I never cared to go from the saddle to Ogden Peak, it being marred by cell tower stuff.

Once at the saddle, consider going down Beus Canyon Trail and then circling back to where you started via the Bonneville Shoreline Trail, but only if you think you've got enough energy and provisions.

8.0,Point to Point,6653,5876,1094,968,5,53,Upper Muley Twist Canyon Trail,Difficult,4.5,"        From the parking area, enter the wide sand wash and head north. As you continue along the trail, a number of washes come in from the left; keep right at these intersections throughout the hike. 

Just over a mile and a half from the trailhead, Muley Arch is visible on the left, followed soon by the impressive Saddle Arch. Across from Saddle Arch, you can see the return route entering back into the wash. To the north, the wash is usually dry, but rain or melting snow can create all kinds of pools and mudholes that can add considerably to the hiking time.

Continuing along the wash, a short section of low-angle sluice adds aesthetic punch with almost every step. Soon, two more arches appear. About a mile ahead, a sharp left-hand bend in the canyon proceeds a steep bypass rising straight ahead up the slickrock. The canyon slot can be explored, but isn't passible so you'll end up back at the bypass.

The bypass contours high above the narrows, with some exposure, before a steep descent briefly returns to the wash before heading up to the ridge above. The climb to the ridge can be a little complicated and requires some navigating and a little scrambling, but you'll soon find your way to the top.

From the ridge, the route continues south in long pleasant descents with plenty of opportunities to soak in the views. Occasional drops in elevation followed by scrambling climbs interrupt this mellow progress. A final long descent ushers hikers back to the wash below for the return to the trailhead.

After that the trail turns into rollers for about a mile, the trail has a lot of rocks on it with a few firm packed spots.  

There is a small trail marker that indicates the trail heads west making a left turn heading into the switchbacks.  The trail switches back and forth between rocky sections and hard-pack and continues to climb for the next mile and a quarter. It then merges with a dirt road for a 0.2-mile climb to the first set of radio towers.  

The downhill commences at this point. The top of the trail has a lot of rocks before giving way to loose dirt combined with hard-pack and some ruts. There is a short climb near the end followed by more downhill over varied terrain, with some rocks thrown in for good measure.  The trail then levels out into on open field where you can keep pushing along until you reach the park. At this point, the trail goes from hard-pack to paved.

16.4,Point to Point,7629,5889,1201,1763,3,29,Upper Spring Canyon,Intermediate/Difficult,4.2,"        The Upper Spring Canyon route requires levels of fitness, route-finding ability, and tolerance of solitude that are well above average. It can be done as an extremely long day hike or as a two or even three day pack. The lack of reliable water for a long portion of the middle of the trek adds to its difficulty.

Whether done in a day or as a backpack (permit required), Upper Spring is a point-to-point hike that requires a shuttle between the two trailheads or a 3.9-mile road hike back to the starting point. The shuttle vehicle or a bike should be left at the Chimney Rock Trailhead, which is 3.1 miles west of the visitor center on Highway 24. Please note that you'll have to make your exit on the Chimney Rock Trail and the Chimney Rock Canyon before reaching the parking area. Parking is available on the outside of the circle, and there is a pit toilet. 

To start the journey, drive west to the Holt Draw Trailhead which is 7.0 miles west of the visitor center on Highway 24 at milepost 72.4, outside of the park. A short track heads north from the pavement, ending in 150 yards at a fence. Park there, or closer to the paved road if the track is too rough for your vehicle.

For more than a mile, the route follows an old road and then the stream bed of Sulphur Creek at a gentle grade. A steep climb out of the drainage leads to a pleasant stroll across the high bench of Cooks Mesa to the base of the climb up through the fabled “W,” a passage through a wall of red Wingate sandstone. Minor scrambling is required to pass through the cleft and descend to Upper Spring Canyon. After passing one significant obstacle and several smaller ones, the journey down canyon is easy going. 

After reaching the end of Upper Spring Canyon in a triple junction with Chimney Rock Canyon and Lower Spring Canyon, follow Chimney Rock Canyon to your shuttle vehicle or bike. The way out to Chimney Rock Canyon and the Chimney Rock Trail is preceded by a lovely section of mature cottonwoods under heavily veiled Wingate walls.

3.4,Point to Point,5791,5139,913,270,7,30,Cottonwood Wash,Difficult,4.5,"        The hike up Cottonwood Wash follows the wash bottom on a mix of gravel, sand, and rocks. The 1.2 miles to where the canyon narrows isn’t particularly scenic, but the distance passes quickly.

As the route enters the Carmel Formation, the walls rise above and the route becomes interesting and far more strenuous. Two faint trails can aide in the early going, especially the second one which follows a sandy climb out of the wash to bypass the boulders below - a welcome option on the return. If you choose to skip the bypass, the boulders in the wash make a fun warmup for the day. The bypass returns to the wash via a slickrock ramp above a scaleable dryfall.

A second fluted bedrock slope signals a nice serpentine narrows with walls about 8 feet apart. Shortly after the narrows, the canyon divides into two quite similar branches, with Cottonwood Wash going right and immediately tightening. A thinner narrows follows shortly with a difficult slot section right behind. A chockstone boulder here may require help to pass.

There’s little easy trail before a skinny, awkward slot with another chockstone. Up next, a huge arrow-shaped boulder blocks the way. Surprisingly, a route goes under the arrow along the right wall, continues under a smaller boulder wedged against the bigger one, and then through a small opening above. Remember this ascent because the return is almost blind.

After conquering the arrow, it’s disappointing to find a long, imposing pool filling an otherwise enticing slot. The pool can be very deep, frigidly cold, and generally unappealing. The difficult chockstone at the end should only be attempted by experienced canyoneers if water is present. This becomes the turn around point for most groups.

Rarely, the pool is dry. If this happens, the chockstone can be passed with a difficult climb from underneath. From this point the route is interesting and relentlessly challenging. A particularly smooth boulder ahead is difficult going for those less than six feet tall. The boulder is best passed by spanning the walls to slither over.

Just beyond is an intriguing pothole with a curving, scaleable entry chute. The reward for this scramble is a long, slanted, narrow slot that may be the best section of the rout. After a pleasant wide, opening in the canyon the home stretch appears. This long section of deep narrows is frequently filled with water. If dry, continue to the 10-foot high dryfall which is the logical turnaround.

The trail soon goes through a chained, but not locked, gate and starts to wind up the canyon alongside Bunchgrass Creek. As the trail continues, the trees thicken for about a mile but then the trail emerges into a series of meadows that have several ponds within them. This area also starts to have beautiful expanses of wildflowers and spread-out quaking aspens. It is a gorgeous area.

After passing the several ponds, the trail starts to wind up and over a series of ridges until it eventually reaches down into White Pine Canyon, and meets up with the White Pine Canyon Trail. From here, the trail veers to the west and heads up this glacially carved canyon, which makes for easy grades and great hiking terrain. The trail is also very soft and powdery, but not sandy which makes for some great hiking through this section. 

The trail goes by White Pine Creek, which often has a good amount of water flowing through it and is really pretty. This area also allows for great views of Mount Gog, one of the two mountains that flanks White Pine Lake. 

After passing through several open meadows of flowers and sagebrush, the trail starts to ascend slightly more steeply as it rises with the steepening creek. After climbing, the trail starts to move on into the canyon that houses White Pine Lake, and you start to get great views of both Gog and Magog. Eventually, the trail ends at a four-way junction that splits off going to Tony Grove or toward the shores of White Pine Lake.

The trail starts to the right end of these boulders and ascends gradually through a small forest in a narrow canyon. Throughout the first mile and a half the trail crosses a (usually dry) stream several times and passes through small meadows and below tall, impressive cliffs. The trail can be somewhat rocky in places due to the geology of this small canyon, but never gets very technical and is always fun. In the fall, the colors can be spectacular and the red-orange leaves cover the trail and the surrounding forest floor. 

After the first mile and a half, the trail reaches a small clearing with a sign that says ""Leatham Hollow Spring"" and not long after this the trail makes an abrupt backward turn to start up some long switchbacks to get to the junction with the Millville Canyon road. Along these switchbacks, the trail passes through several kinds zones of scenery as it crosses several drainages. Along this long switchback you can see pine forests, tall grasses and scrub oak, small rocky crags. Sometimes you get an opening in the forest and amazing views of the cliffs that line the upper portion of Leatham Hollow, as well as the Mahogany Range to the southeast. From some portions you can even see the Left Hand Fork of the Blacksmith Fork River, as well as the parking area, almost 2,000 feet below.

Eventually the trail hits the end of the long switchback, and then turns back towards Millville Canyon, and after the last long ascent it finally breaks out into a large sagebrush meadow and finally hits the Millville Canyon Road, where there is a sign (facing the opposite direction) that says ""Leatham Hollow.""

Then the trail continues to ascend up past some amazing limestone formations and eventually breaks out (and levels out more) into a wide meadow that follows the path of a small meandering stream. In this long meadow, the trail ascends very gradually and crosses the stream several times. 

Eventually, you'll reach the ""Elbow"" where large groves of aspen can be seen in the surrounding hills.

The trail continues on past a National Forest signboard area and then a couple of gates, and from there, the trees start to come in a little bit closer around the trail, offering good shade during the day. 

The trail continues up eventually passing through a large grove of aspens and then, when you emerge from the grove, the trail starts to switchback up until you get to the top of a large knoll with very large trees on top of it. The trail continues on until you reach a junction with the South Syncline Trail, which goes off to the right and goes around to the south side of Logan Peak. The actual Logan Dry Canyon trail continues up and then cuts to the left and starts to ascend up to the ridge that sits on the north side of Dry Canyon. This trail quickly leaves the vegetated forests of Dry Canyon for an exposed hillside covered in sagebrush and some scattered trees.

There are many dozens of small pools with standing water along the way. After a rainstorm, it could be possible for flowing water to connect the pools. 

Parking is at the ""Many Pools Trailhead"" parking lot, where even on busy days there is are open spots because most people park there just to use the new, double pit toilet. The trailhead is not labeled by Zion NP as this is not an official park trail, but the parking lot is now clearly signed. 

Park on the north side of the road near the pit toilets.  There start are a couple of social trails to take you down about 30 feet to the beginning of the sandy wash. After that, hike up the slick rock inside the small valley, going past small pools of water. There are more pools towards the end of the hike, but turn around at any point after you have had your fill.

9.4,Point to Point,8368,6199,437,2343,6,16,Wasatch Over Wasatch,Intermediate,4.5,"        If you chose to hike out-and-back, this makes for a long hike. If shuttled from the top Parking lot, there is 200' climb then descending at a steady grade on loose dirt and narrow singletrack, but with great views.  This trail is heavily used by mountain bikers, be aware of your surroundings and of other users on the trail. 

To begin the out and back drive up SR 222 from Midway, UT toward Wasatch State Park/ Guardsman's Pass. About a 1/4 of a mile past the State Park Campground, there is a dirt pullout and trailhead on the east side of the road, park there. This is called Pine Canyon Trailhead. Cross the road, then the wooden footbridge and continue up the well-built switchbacks and berms.

If you are going to do W.o.W. trail as a shuttle, continue up SR 222 after the bottom trailhead for about 3.4 miles (You can also drive down from Gaurdsman's or Deer Valley, just get a shuttle car to the bottom).

You'll see 3 concrete barriers on the west side of the road with room for 3 parked cars. Park there, hike past the north side of Hardy Lake (which is probably just a mud puddle) on an old doubletrack road for 0.1 mile and link into the singletrack on the left. The tail weaves up 200 ft on a mellow grade before beginning the descent. As you descend enjoy the views and the switchbacks as they make the grade much easier.

3.8,Point to Point,6771,6242,522,611,6,18,Phosphate Hill Trail,Intermediate,4.5,"        Phosphate Hill Trail is one of the newer trails in the Dutch Hollow trail network. The trail can be done as a loop with Prospector Trail from Pine Canyon or Dutchman Way.

The loop is a mix of moderate climbing and descending with some very mild rougher sections. The northern side of the loop is a moderate (occasionally steep) climb via many switchbacks, up and over a steep mountain ridge. Once on the east side, you'll experience smoother surface through maple forest. 

The western side provides a change of vegetation with freer slopes covered in oak brush. There are also more turns and the tread can be a bit loose, making for slippery footing. 

On the south side of the route, the trail follows a mostly level contour (only a couple up and downs) with nice views of Midway and Burgi Hill.

At the same time, unlike most hikes in the Wasatch, I do not recommend doing this one alone. There is at least one mountain lion that lives in the canyon, and there are many moose. Watch out for hunters too.

The trail is difficult to follow. If in doubt, just follow the drainage.

The trail is shaded to start, and drops down immediately, winding down and down. There are a couple of spots where you'll see the road and even a couple trails heading off to the left into Cutler Basin. After it levels out, it starts to climb again but fairly gradually and on an even grade. A couple of wooden bridges cross the small creek. Next thing you know, you'll be crossing the paved road and starting the Mule Ear Trail.

6.1,Point to Point,8615,5010,3605,1,11,25,Spring Hollow,Difficult,4.5,"        As soon as you leave River Trail the intermediate singletrack begins.  Switchbacks, and a few rocky areas can be expected through the first bit of climbing and descending.  During these first few sections you'll see several trails taking off and forking.  Always take the one to the right to go towards Spring Hollow. Going left on any of these will take you back down to a trail running along the river.  Take a right again at the second fork. This is where the climbing starts to pick up.  

It gets steep pretty quickly and starts going in towards the canyon.  Adequate tree coverage makes for a nice cool hike, and great terrain.  The last climb to the slate field is a brutal one, and is what to expect the rest of the way to the top.  It will be pretty obvious when you reach the slate field, as there are no trees, and many rocks.  

For the sake of your sanity, you can turn around here to enjoy the downhill and the scenery, or you can choose your fate and try to climb to the top.  As I said, that last climb is just a taste of what the next 4 miles hold.  Steep sections will hold a whole new meaning in your life after this. But to those who conquer, we salute you.  

This advanced trail is extremely steep and rocky which makes the downhill worth it in the end.  After this slate field, there will be several sections where you'll grind up a few climbs. These conditions will continue for the next mile until you reach a second slate field.  From here until the top the incline decreases and is easier to hike.  The trail then tops out onto a dirt road near Logan Peak.

On your way down, you'll see little traffic until you reach the first slate field you passed on your way up.  While passing the second slate you field you passed on your way up, get ready for a gnarly, steep and rocky downhill.  Follow the way you came down to the bottom of the singletrack and hook back onto the gravel path to get back to your car.  You do have the option to shuttle this trail from the dirt road at the top as well.

The first half has some big ruts and is in need of some TLC. After the halfway point when you are fully in the short scrubby oaks, the trail becomes a lot of fun as it winds down through the trees.

7.0,Point to Point,6259,5315,985,991,5,24,Jackalope Trail,Difficult,4.5,"        Head out of the east parking lot and take a left. The trail will meander for a few miles on the And Cookies Trail. You'll eventually come to a fork with a well-placed sign. Follow the sign and go right at the fork. This is where the climb begins. From here on out the climb is fairly consistent. It's not too bad and there are no real technical challenges along the way.

At about 3/4th of the way from the top you'll come to another fork. This is where the Serendipity trail drops off. You'll take a left at this fork and continue on the climb. 

Once at the top you'll come to a faded doubletrack. It looks as if you can take a left and continue off the ridge to the prominence. But you'll want to take a right onto the doubletrack. This is the start of the descent. The next couple of miles are relatively steep and loose. You'll drop into and out of a couple of washes with slight climbs back out, but, for the most part, the trail is a fun descent. 

You'll eventually come to a trail intersection in one of these washes. This is where you meet back up to the Serendipity Trail. It continues through the wash, but you'll want to once again follow the signs and go straight through the wash and make the slight climb back up out. From here you'll be on top of a small plateau the trail continues in a nice winding manner along this plateau for a little while. 

Once you come to the edge of the plateau you'll see the trail as it dips off on a short steep descent. This is the roughest part of the whole trail with a couple of small ledges a large step down. It is nothing too challenging though. From here the rest of the trail winds through terrain similar to the beginning with short climbs and descents until you come back to the parking lot.

It crosses a wooden bridge and then starts the singletrack trail that follows Spring Creek pretty closely for the first two miles or so. 

The trail undulates as it follows the creek, sometimes being high above the creek and other times being right next to it. As the trail ascends, it weaves in and out of the woods and meadows that make up the bottom of Providence Canyon. 

At the end of the trail, it emerges back onto the Providence Canyon road just below the quarry. You can turn around from here and enjoy the downhill!

4.0,Point to Point,8221,6963,1259,1,6,13,Armstrong,Intermediate,4.3,"        The Armstrong Trail is a relatively new, multi-use trail. Its popularity is increasing because it helps spread out traffic on the mountain and improves users' experiences.  Armstrong is a directional trail for bikers (uphill only) but hikers can go up or down.  

Armstrong climbs at a remarkably constant, moderate grade that makes the uphill pretty enjoyable. To start, the trail contours around the hillside mostly shaded by aspen trees.  After passing the base of the King Con chairlift, the serious switchbacking begins, although this ascent feels gentler than the Spiro Trail.  

Armstrong makes major connections with a number of trails including the Mid Mountain Trail.  To reach the start of the Armstrong Trail, either take the Silver Spur trail from the ski area base or head through the Silver Star and golf course neighborhood to where the Spiro Trail and Armstrong trails hit Crescent Road.

7.3,Point to Point,5887,5221,1018,1677,7,36,Lower Spring Canyon,Intermediate,4.1,"        Lower Spring Canyon is initially rocky, but not difficult as it descends to the Fremont River. Along the way there are twisting narrows, and the canyon itself is very scenic. Just under 4 miles from the trailhead, an interesting shallow slot begins in a section of sculpted bedrock in the canyon floor. This side trip is worth the effort, and you'll enjoy the up close views of the winding curves of Capitol Reef sandstone. The slot can be negotiated for 500 feet before it ends at an impassable pour-off above a pool and mudhole. At this point, the safest retreat to the main wash is to simply return the way you came. On your way back to the main route, you'll bypass an optional detour on the northern side that has recently been made dangerous by flood damage.

Once you've made your way back to the main wash, you'll continue for about another 3 miles to the wash's end. Be aware that at the end of your journey, the Fremont River must be forded, a task that is usually easy but can be dangerous during times of high water. The best crossing is usually found near a low cliff on the right of the wash, along a path through dense stream-side willows. Cross the river to a sandbar and the easy egress on the opposite side. After the remote solitude of navigating the wash, the parking area and sudden approach to UT 24 can be a striking juxtaposition. Nonetheless, this is a spectacular route.

14.3,Point to Point,6423,5366,642,1699,3,53,Kane Gulch Trail,Difficult,4.3,"        The full trail is often completed as a three day backpack, looping back via Bullet Canyon Trail.

Starting right out of the ranger station, cross the road and enjoy easy hiking in the desert wash. Pass through tall tunnels of grass until the canyon starts in about a mile. There's an unusual stand of aspen trees here, which would normally require a much higher elevation. But they have survived in this micro-climate as clones of the same tree for 11,000 years!

At 2.0 miles, the canyon opens to a huge bowl and pour-over. The canyon becomes much deeper now with imposing walls on each side. You'll cross the stream many times, but the trail remains easy (though not always easy to find - look for cairns!).

At 4.0 miles, you come to an major side canyon to the right and a huge grove of cottonwoods. Look up to the right on the cliff, and you'll see the Junction Ruins - perched under a huge overhang with excellent natural protection. Below the cliff is the ""midden,"" or trash heap. Yep, this is where they threw the trash from the ruins above. Tons of broken pottery shards litter the ground. Respect the area and do not disturb the remains. There are fun ruins to explore on ground level as well as the higher ones, which you cannot access.

Back on the trail, continue 0.7 miles to the Turkey Pen Ruin, with more houses up high on the cliff. Down below are many houses and a kiva that you can explore. The highlight here is a set of sticks that have stood for nearly 1,000 years and appears to be a pen to hold turkeys. Excellent petroglyphs line the wall.

At 7.2 miles, Todie Canyon comes in on the left. You can potentially escape back to the road by climbing out of this canyon.

After passing a major pour-over that you have to hike around (look for cairns!), you reach Split Level Ruin, which comes into view at 10 miles.

Pass Coyote Canyon at around 13 miles, and look for the incredible pictographs at the Green Mask ruin soon after. 

The canyon comes to an end at a junction with another canyon. Most will return the way that they came.

4.0,Point to Point,11229,8226,3511,2960,31,88,The Triple Traverse Route,Very Difficult,4.2,"        This is an exposed ridge scramble that visits three prominent peaks on the ridgeline dividing the Big and Little Cottonwood canyons. It is a fantastic outing!

After hiking up the Broads Fork Trail #055, look for the split where one part of the trail continues deeper into the fork while the other heads over to Bonkers, a well-known slide-path. The hike up Bonkers is quite steep, but manageable. Continue up until you reach the saddle at the top of Stairs Gulch.

From here, gain the ridge north of the east summit of Twin Peaks, and hike the ridge to that summit. After visiting the west summit too, continue south along the ridge, but quickly drop off of it on the west side into a small couloir, then regain the ridge lower down. This circumvents some 5th-class down-climbing on the ridge. Shortly after regaining the ridge, you'll find yourself on the saddle between Twin Peaks and Sunrise Peak (sometimes called O'Sullivan Peak.)

The trail from here to Sunrise Peak is the hardest of the entire route. Look around to find the path of least resistance and minimal risk. Once on top of Sunrise Peak, make your way east to the saddle between it and Dromedary Peak. This is also the top of Tanners Gulch, another well-known slide-path. Now drop off of Dromedary along the east ridge. (You can also drop off the north ridge, but it is a much harder descent.)

Make your way carefully into Lake Blanche fork. This part of the route is made difficult and a bit monotonous by a seemingly endless boulder field. With persistence, you'll eventually find your way to Lake Lillian and link up with the Lake Blanche Trail.

Note that the Lake Blanche Fork and Broads Fork trails share the same trail-head, so you can easily make a big loop of this hike.

0.6,Point to Point,5802,5561,44,242,10,34,Moon House Trail,Intermediate,4.3,"        This short trail is used to access the main Moon House ruin from the parking area at the end of the Moon House Approach road. The trail is marked by cairns, so just keep an eye open and you shouldn't lose your way. 

The trail starts out pretty flat, heading through scrubby pinyon pine, juniper, and rabbitbrush. Stick to the rocks and marked trail to make sure you don't damage the dark (and alive!) cryptobiotic soil in the area. 

The canyon rim opens up suddenly and impressively from the flat ground that you have been hiking. Be sure to look across the canyon to see if you can spot the ruins as it is truly impressive to see them perched on the far side of the canyon wall.

From here the drop into the canyon is steep. You'll be crossing several large slabs of slickrock and a couple tight switchbacks with loose rock. There is one section that will require jumping (or scooting) down a small ledge onto a stack of rocks that others have kindly stacked to make for an easier descent/ascent. 

At just under half a mile, the trail will drop to the canyon floor. Depending on the time of year there may be water flowing in the small creek or there may just be some pools of water and a dry creek bed to cross. There are several massive black and red striated boulders on the canyon floor and a cool overhang to explore.  Gaze around to find the looming hoodoos. 

From here, it is just a short, quick uphill with one tiny section of scrambling to reach the main Moon House Ruin. These Anasazi dwellings, pictographs and storage bins are ancient and obviously should not be touched or bumped.  Do not take any materials.  Be sure to allow plenty of time to explore the ruin and surrounding area before heading back the way you came.

4.0,Point to Point,4616,4070,267,721,5,19,Hunter Canyon Rim,Difficult,4.3,"        Pick a day after recent rain for the best sand conditions and cooler temperatures--there's precious little shade on this trail. Come loaded with extra food and water in case you bonk, get lost, or otherwise have an epic journey. I highly recommend a good map or the Hiking Project mobile app: there are a lot of spur road options. 

However, once you reach the trailhead, hike out Behind The Rocks Road, keeping to the main graded road past many spurs.  The road has occasional carsonite markers and the spurs are mostly smaller, so you shouldnt have too much trouble staying on route. There are however, three major exceptions: in the first 1/2-mile, and where the road drops into two big cottonwood washes. When in doubt, go left.

You'll encounter graded road, sand, loose rubble, ledges, slickrock and finally singletrack on this trail. The faint one-track segment at the end of the trail can be a tricky to follow as it snakes over slickrock benches and through boulder gardens. Fortunately, the Hunter Canyon Rim is narrow, so its hard to get too lost without rappelling off a cliff.

The hike back down is very enjoyable. I cannot stress how beautiful this area is in the height of autumn.

Get on Parrish Lane in Centerville and head east towards the mountains as far as you can. Before the road bends south, see the small, paved road going north. This goes to the trailhead which is directly across from the fire-break road. 

Be careful to look both ways before crossing this road. Also, this winding road up to the trailhead is a bit narrow, so watch for oncoming traffic.

The trail itself is rolling, but maintains gentle elevation change throughout. There are a couple of larger climbs, but everything is manageable.  Set up as a loop, this trail is can be taken clockwise, counterclockwise, or one can stop at the doubletrack and double the distance to nearly 12 miles as an out-and-back. 

While winding in and out of alpine meadows, into pine and aspen groves this trail has views aplenty to admire along the way. The majority of the trail is smooth clay singletrack, but builders have added rock slabs in several areas to add a mild technical element and keep things interesting.   

Minimal climbing and easy technical elements make this a great loop for beginners and younger hikers, especially if you shorten the full loop to be a smaller out and back.

The Hurricane Rim trail is an out-and-back trail, but can be combined with other trails to make a long loop if you prefer.  As with all of the trails in the Hurricane, Utah area, there are amazing vistas in almost every direction. You're at the doorstep of Zion National Park.

It can be hikeed from either the lower JEM trailhead, or the Hurricane Rim trailhead.  

To get to the lower JEM trailhead go east on State Road 9 and turn right onto Sheep Bridge Road (just before you enter Virgin, Utah). Cross over the Virgin River on the bridge and take the first right after the cattle guard. Follow the two track about a half mile to the end (this is the trailhead and parking). 

For the Hurricane Rim trailhead, go south about a mile on US-59 up the hill above Hurricane City. Watch for the Hurricane Rim trailhead on your left. The parking area shares space with cell phone towers. Starting from the Hurricane Rim trailhead go east up the hill just outside of the fence that follows the highway.  It is easy to follow.

From the saddle set your sights due south on the summit of Box Elder. The trail follows a mix of good footpaths and hardly noticeable social trails. As you head towards the peak, simply follow the ridge. Good route finding skills are key, though the path is pretty straight forward.

Simply stick close to the ridge until you gain the summit. Take a good break at the USGS marker for the summit high point. Close to that marker is a summit register. On the way down make sure to follow the correct ridge. While it is not difficult, make sure to double check your chosen path. Follow the same route back to the saddle.

Start by hiking up the gravel road from the parking area, in a tenth of a mile you'll see a sign on your left for North 40, take this left.  After a brief climb, you'll enter the loop.

4.9,Point to Point,8608,5317,3312,21,13,48,Spring Hollow Trail,Difficult,4.3,"        From the bridge over the creek, the trail immediately starts to climb the rocky Spring Hollow and soon passes the fork in the trail that goes to the Crimson Trail. After this, the trail only seems to steepen for a short time, and then after about a half mile the forest opens up as the trail reaches a section of short switchbacks that look like they were blasted into the hillside because of all of the crushed rock. This is a neat section, and a nice respite from the steep climbing that precedes it, and the switchbacks seem very gradual in comparison. After the switchbacks, the trail goes back into the forest and climbs steeply again as it goes toward the head of Spring Hollow. 

About a mile from the switchbacks, the trail emerges from the forest again and gives great views down into the steep gully that sits right below the trail. Then, the trail curves around through another rocky section and ascends on a narrow tread along a hillside until it reaches a really pretty meadow. The climbing definitely slows down in this section as the trail goes through this meadow and just slowly climbs up and through a couple of drainages, and then by a couple of large karst sinks as it goes towards a great overlook where you can see a lot of Logan Canyon, and even into Logan City. 

After this overlook, the trail goes back into the forest and starts a long series of switchbacks through massive pine trees. This section is really great as the trees provide a great sense of solitude and the trail is really well developed (I think the switchbacks were put in somewhat recently). Eventually, the trail reaches the last switchback and starts to come out of the large forest, and passes by some really interesting rock formations, and finally comes to an end at the Inspiration Point Road FR 126.

1.9,Point to Point,7295,5778,1517,0,15,33,Wind Caves Way,Intermediate,4.2,"        This trail is practically one really long switchback leaving from the Wind Caves Trail about halfway up to get to the ridge that leads over to Beirdneau Peak. For the most part, it is a beautiful trail with a nice grade for heading up or down, although it does get steep at some points. To get to where the trail starts, follow the Wind Caves Trail for about 1 mile or more until you see a split in the trails at the end of a switchback where there is a brown ""designated use"" sign. The fork that goes to the right is the trail that goes up to the ridge.

As the trail leaves the Wind Caves Trail, it starts to climb through a small, sparse forest but pretty soon gets out into a barren, rocky hillside and traverse for a while until it reaches the point where it switches back and starts ascending to the west. As it ascends, it crosses several drainages and goes through various types of vegetation - tall grasses, where elk and deer sometimes sleep, and scrub oak forests, etc. As the trail gets closer to the ridge, you can see several rock outcroppings up above, and if you take a look to the south you can get great views of the China Wall and the Crimson Trail. Once you reach the top, you can get great views of the gullies below Logan Peak and all of the cliffs below it as well.

2.2,Point to Point,8887,5274,3612,0,31,105,Mahogany Mountain North Peak Trail,Difficult,4.2,"        The elevation change over distance says it all. In a bit under 2.5 miles you climb 3600+ ft in elevation, but the work comes with a reward. This peak offers a 360-degree view of the valley and you'll have no trouble seeing the Oquirrhs, the Salt Lake and Antelope Island, Lone Peak, Box Elder Peak, Mt Timpanogos, Mount Nebo... breathtaking views.

The hardest part of the elevation gain might be the terrain. There are no real switchbacks, the trail follows ridgelines until it no longer can then just shoots straight up the mountain to the next ridgeline. In many places the trail also skirts sheer drop-offs, so if you don't like heights, this may not be the route for you.

Overall though, this route leads to an incredible view and is a real butt-kicker!

You'll note that along this trail, the flora changes from deciduous trees and lush, low shrubs, to dry conifers. As the dense deciduous foliage of the forest starts to thin, the views of Hammond Canyon proper become more apparent.

Continue down this tight, somewhat elusive trail as it finally reaches the Hammond Canyon Creek. From here, the trail meanders along and around the creekbed, slowly falling in elevation. In some of these sections, you'll be surrounded by thick horsetail reeds as well as dense manzanita shrubs. Don't forget to look up, however, as the towering sandstone pillars should be coming into view now.

Eventually, the trail reaches a double waterfall (which must be stunning in Spring). This proves a good resting point or a place to eat lunch.

From here, the trail continues east. If you have time, be sure not to miss Three Finger Ruin! We didn't have time to see it, but it's supposed to be amazingly well-preserved. I've noted its location as an information symbol on the map.

The trail eventually reaches an intersection with Cream Pots Trail (005) and Posey Canyon Trail (166).

Be sure to give yourself a bit of time to acclimate before this outing, as the trail sits around 8,000 feet above sea level.   For this reason, it is also sometimes called the 8,000 ft Trail.

You can access this trail from a few different locations and do it in sections to make it as long or short as you like.  A particularly nice place to begin the trail is from Park City Mountain Resort, ascending Armstrong Trail or Spiro Trail. You can also start at the bottom of Mid Mountain trail, in Deer Valley at Silver Lake Village.  

Either way, you'll encounter truly extraordinary views of the area as you make your way along the Mid Mountain Trail.  There's significant climbing to get up to the trail no matter where you start, but the Deer Valley access and the Spiro Trail climb are both manageable and gradual, not straight up and down.

Mid Mountain Trail is beautiful singletrack through a combination of deep forest, brief passes through open meadows, and along a ridge line. There's a bit of ascending as you make your way north, but nothing brutal.  You'll also stay interested with periodic beautiful views out over Park City. You're also likely to see wildflowers and aspen groves along the way. 

At the northern end of the trail, you'll have more trail options to choose from in order to return to civilization.  Most hikers will find their way down into Canyons Resort, then either get a ride from a friend or take the bus back to their starting point.  Note: bikes are allowed on this trail.

Below the waterfall are the most scenic sections of the trail. The canyon is narrow, but never a real slot, as it's probably around six feet wide at its narrowest. Enjoy the yellow and black colors on the wall.

Maybe 3/4 a mile in, a side canyon comes in from the left. This is a good turn around spot for those who have had their fill, or visitors can continue on.

Because of its remote location and virtual inaccessibility, Kolob Arch for years has challenged cowboys, rangers, hikers, climbers, and photographers alike. For most of the twentieth century many believed that Kolob was in fact the worlds largest freestanding arch, leading to years of debate and the motivation for various parties of adventurous thrill seekers to climb on and around the massive span in hopes of securing a defensible measurement.

Despite its isolated location, Kolob Arch has become a favorite backcountry destination for thousands of visitors to Zion. They discover what most arch seekers will tell you: while beauty awaits every seeker at the end of the path, the reward begins unfolding at the trailhead. Along the trail to Kolob Arch lies some of the most beautiful scenery in Zion. Geology becomes art as the La Verkin Creek, with its soothing sounds of life-giving water, sculpts some of the most colorful canyon walls in Southwestern Utah. Awe inspiring views of the Kolob Terrace along the trail give a tired hiker many places to stop and recharge while gazing upon the high plateau country of Zion. 

Wildlife abounds in these protected canyons and hikers will encounter reptiles, birds, and mammals. Seven miles along the trail, one is rewarded with a sight not seen by most of Zions two and a half million annual visitors, the impressive expanse of Kolob Arch. With a span of 287 feet and a thickness of 75 feet, most experts now agree that Kolob Arch is not the worlds largest span in terms of measurement, but visitors concur with the claim that it is certainly one of the most beautiful and massive arches surrounded and protected by the majestic scenery of Zion.

The trail starts to ascend immediately, but after a short hill the trail levels out and drops gradually down into the Blind Hollow drainage. 

From here the trail follows the drainage up to the north and crosses the (usually dry) creek several times. In the spring, the creek if full with the snow melt runoff, and it's a really pretty creek when it's running. Be aware, it can make things pretty muddy on the trail when water is there. 

The Blind Hollow drainage is interesting in that one side (the west, or left as you're going up) is always very steep while the other side (east) is usually a pretty gradual slope. The western side is also very rocky in places and has some really cool rock formations that are clearly visible from the trail as you ascend. 

After about 2 miles from the trailhead, there is a split in the trail that goes off to the left. This path goes up to an interesting area with a few karst sinks and a few caves as well most of which are a good distance away from the trail. If you're not a caver, pass by this split, and continue on as the trail passes through a large meadow with more interesting rock formations to the left, following the drainage up towards its head.

After a little bit less than another mile, the trail starts to curve to the west and soon reaches another junction with a trail that goes up to Hansen Pond, and if you go even farther, Tony Grove Lake. After passing this junction, the trail continues to pass in and out of beautiful conifer and aspen forests. 

Eventually, the trail passes close by the Blind Hollow Yurt which is usually used in the winter by backcountry skiers or snowboarders and then soon after that the trail ends at the ridge that marks the boundary between Cottonwood Canyon and Blind Hollow. From this ridge, you can get beautiful views of Cottonwood Canyon, Mount Elmer, and the surrounding areas.

The parking at the trailhead is shared with a picnic area accessible via a twisty single lane 1/4 mile road. On weekends/summer it may be easier to park off of the main road and walk up. The entire trail except the very uppermost section is within the Mount Olympus Wilderness, so mountain bikes are not permitted. Dogs are allowed and plentiful, especially on ""off-leash"" days which are odd days. On even days, dogs must be leashed. For the first mile, the trail follows a gentle creek with a handful of basic bridged crossings. Once the trail departs the creek, it climbs along the hillside with just a few switchbacks. At White Fir Pass, there is a flat spot to take a break on some logs. The trail then takes a 90 degree turn to the Southeast and continues to climb. There's a brief reprieve at Yellowjacket Gulch before the trail starts climbing steeply again. Just below Gobbler's Knob as the trail reaches the ridge, it junctions with Desolation Trail #19 and the Mill A Basin.

This trail feels significantly easier to me done in the north/west direction because of the way the rock under foot is fractured. When hiking in the south/east direction, it is fractured and jutting out at an angle toward you—making for slightly more tricky footwork.

The only rather difficult bit is around the middle section of the trail where it gets very curvy, and you have to dip steeply down into the canyon. This small section has loose rocks and should be approached slowly.

All-in-all, this is the best way to enjoy a quiet trail with great views and without driving far.

46.9,Point to Point,4609,4216,1010,725,1,11,Jordan River Trail,Easy,4.3,"        In a state chock full of 4- and 5-star hikes, this is a decidedly 2-star hike. The fully paved trail runs the length of Salt Lake valley for 45 miles from the north end of Salt Lake county to the north end of Utah Lake in Saratoga Springs, paralleling the pea soup green Jordan River—Utah's answer to Joyce's snotgreen sea. 

The Jordan river is an important wildlife corridor. Despite the surrounding and often monotonous development, the land managers, operating as the Jordan River Commission, did well to complete this trail before it was too late to establish connectivity.

Drawbacks aside, for folks living in the sprawl west of I-15 this is often the closest trail. And it is a winter option for everyone when going into the mountains would mean snowshoes or backcountry skis. Birders may give it a 1-star boost. And on a clear winter day it affords simultaneous views of the snowcapped Wasatch and Oquirrh mountains, and a wetlands experience at your feet.

Hardly anyone will hike this end-to-end, 45 miles of hiking being better invested elsewhere in Utah. Realistically most hikers will do an out-and-back for a few miles near their home or perhaps drive a little and hike a new stretch. One could cycle it from end-to-end though again there are better places for a long ride in Utah.

I only know the several mile stretch around Lehi. Consult the North Segment and South Segment maps (big PDFs), split at 9000 S, for more information. The Jordan River Commission website and the My Jordan River website provide good background information.

1.0,Point to Point,5944,5657,290,12,6,14,Moonshine Arch Trail,Intermediate,3.9,"        This is a one mile trail following an existing jeep trail to Moonshine Arch, an 85 foot long natural sandstone arch with a 40 foot tall window. It is a fairly easy, family friendly hike. You can access the trail from an easily traveled dirt road to the gate. ATVs or high-clearance 4WD vehicles could go further on the trail to an upper trailhead.

To access the trail heading north from Vernal, drive on Hwy 191. When you pass the entrance to Steinaker State Park on your left, continue to travel on 191 for just under a mile to a curve in the road. In about the middle of the curve you'll see a dirt/gravel road off to the left. Follow that road until you see a smooth dirt road off to the left (there is a sign there for the arch) and then travel that road to the gate. The parking lot at the gate is usually full of mini vans and cars.

3.2,Point to Point,6871,6305,696,244,5,17,Little Mountain Ridge,Intermediate,4.0,"        This is a ridge trail that simultaneously offers views of Salt Lake City to the west looking down Emigration Canyon and views east of Little Dell Reservoir and the often snowcapped Bald Mountain. The trail starts at the high point of Emigration Canyon Rd and begins with a short steep climb to the ridge. It ends near Birch Spring. Setup a shuttle at Affleck Park if you only want to do it one way, a good plan if you are hiking it with small children. Or combine a bike ride up Emigration Canyon with this trail.

One of the things I've always loved about Salt Lake is how quickly you can hike out of the city. City Creek Canyon is of course the obvious example. The Little Mountain Ridge Trail, which is only a short drive from the University of Utah, is a great after work escape and often rewards one with beautiful sunsets. Some days it feels like one could just keep hiking, leaving all troubles behind.

This is a great evening hike. Start the trail right as the sun dips below the rim and you'll have plenty of daylight to finish your hike. The easiest direction to hike is from south to north as its is mostly all downhill.

Start with the La Sals at your back as the trail climbs and descends along the south side of the Moab rim. You'll climb and descend plenty of tight switchbacks and rocky sections.

The trail can be accessed from 3 Trailheads:
-Aspen Ave. off of Kane Creek Blvd. right in town, minimal parking
-Jackson Street across highway 191 from 400E on South end of town, no parking.
-Hidden Valley Trailhead at Angel Rock Road. (mile marker 122) has the most parking. Hidden Valley is another popular hiking trail.

5.8,Point to Point,5922,4250,188,1768,6,76,Wilhite Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        Typical of Island in the Sky, the Wilhite Trail first travels across the arid mesa top before the route branches off downhill and wraps west, garnering your first glimpse at Candlestick Tower. Slowly losing ground, the trail finally comes to the crux of the route at the canyon rim a mere mile from the trailhead.

From here, a remarkable series of switchbacks unfold to navigate an ancient rockslide. Where headway seemed impossible at every turn, the route somehow threaded through the terrain with seamless ease. Leveling briefly on an exposed ledge perched alongside the mesa, the Buttes of the Cross slip into view. When seen from the northeast, the moniker manifests when together these two landmarks form a cross. One final descent brings you the final three-hundred feet to a wash on the canyon floor.

The trail then winds with the wash to its convergence with Holeman Spring Creek in the heart of Holeman Spring Basin. Following the dry bed of Holeman Spring Creek, the route ends at White Rim Road after a total of 5.2 miles.

Holeman Slot at the end of Holeman Spring Creek is an anomaly in Canyonlands National Park. The softer Navajo Sandstone most conducive to forming slot canyons can only be seen in higher altitudes of the park, but here, seasonal streams eat away at the White Rim Sandstone, causing the slot to form. Be careful—Holeman Slot may be easy to slip into, but it grows deeper with each step. Climbing out can be a challenge, especially when the rock is wet.

The red-coated Wingate Sandstone cliffs on both sides soar upwards about 350 feet. The floor of the canyon makes for easy navigation with no major obstacles, while lush and diverse vegetation adds to the ambiance. There are three side canyons that enter from the left, but the main canyon is easy to follow. 

Starting from the junction with the Chimney Rock Trail, head down the primitive path to the wash below. Follow the wash for roughly a mile before reaching a signed junction with Spring Canyon and the trail's end. Those wishing to return to their car at the Chimney Rock Trail Parking Area can simply return the way they came. For those who wish to extend their journey, see Lower Spring Canyon.

Stay on Park Road 19 for 2.2 miles until you approach the first large rock formation and see a parking area to the west.  This is the trailhead for Eye of the Whale Trail.

From the trailhead, the arch may not seem that noteworthy and won't really resemble a whale yet.  Pass through the arch on this mellow 1/4 mile path, then turn around to look backwards.  From the backside it is easy to see the heavy brow and eye hole of the whale.

1.6,Point to Point,5902,5526,398,22,5,12,Right Hand Fork Logan River Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        From the trailhead/parking lot, the trail very gradually starts to ascend alongside the Right Hand Fork of the Logan River. This is a beautiful section of the river with plenty of cold water flowing through it year round, and it is usually filled with beautiful green vegetation inside the river itself. During the fall, this is a gorgeous place to see the changing leaves as well.

Not far from the trailhead, a split in the trail occurs as the Maughan Hollow Trail goes off to the left and up, while the Right Hand Fork Trail continues alongside the river. Not far from this fork, the trail passes the first (of many) beaver dam, which creates a pretty cascade in front of it and pool behind it. There are several more of these beaver dams clearly visible from the trail as it continues to lazily ascend alongside the river through this beautiful forested area. 

About a half a mile from the trailhead, the trail crosses the river via a small footbridge, and then reaches a new fork in the trail. The trail that goes off to the left (and through a gate) is the Rick's Canyon Trail #127, which later branches off into the Steel Hollow Trail. However, the Right Hand Fork Trail branches off to the left and continues to follow along the river. 

At this point, the trail starts to ascend a little bit more as the river steepens slightly, and it also crosses a few talus piles (although the trail is well developed still) and crosses the river and a few dry creek beds a few times along the way toward the head of the Right Hand Fork. Along this section, there are several interesting rock formations above, as well as more beautiful autumn colors (in the fall)

Eventually, the trail forks one last time, with the main part of the trail going up (to the left) into the Willow Creek drainage along the Willow Creek Trail. The actual Right Hand Fork Trail continues to the right, although it quickly becomes overgrown and becomes indistinguishable.

Head left to descend Gooseberry (going right takes you to an overlook).  The descent is unrelenting in grade and has a few exposed sections with chopped steps and others with loose rock.  

Once you reach the wash you'll follow it down the canyon with cairns to reassure you are on track.  Make sure you look around at the trail/wash junction to remember what it looks like for the climb back up.   A few miles of nice wash hiking leads to the White Rim Trail just north of the Gooseberry campsites (permits required through NPS).  There is no water on the trail, but there is a bathroom at the campsites.  

From here you can either return the way you came or explore the rolling doubletrack of the White Rim Trail in either direction.  Going right (south) from the Gooseberry Junction is very scenic and has a tendency to keep pulling you further and further to see what lies around the corner.

As you hike this jeep road watch for opportunities to get grand views of the Moab valley to the northeast and the La Sal Mountains to the southeast. 

When you are close to large Moab Rim Arch see if you can also spot smaller Tukunikivatz Arch on the horizon to the right. The end of the road is marked with a sign. Now you'll need to decide if you're up for an off-trail adventure to get a closer look at Tukunikivatz Arch (called that because from the west side the arch frames Mount Tukunikvatz perfectly) or perhaps other explorations of the Behind the Rocks Wilderness Study Area might strike your fancy. Either way the hike back on this jeep road is equally appealing because of the views of mountains and slickrock fins.

2.3,Point to Point,7716,5015,2721,20,23,56,Ridgeline Trail,Difficult,3.8,"        From King Nature Park, the trail starts out on the north side of the small pond near the parking lot. It starts going up right away, steepens quickly, and stays steep for most of the entire trail. The trail goes up through some small juniper forests, past some park benches and continues to ascend the ridge to the northeast. There are many loose rocks, gravel, sand and other hazards—very good shoes should be worn to keep traction 

This is a great trail for those who are wanting some good exercise on steep terrain but still enjoy some amazing views. Eventually, the trail reaches a small section where it ""levels out"" or, at least, becomes less steep for a short distance as it winds through a small meadow. Shortly thereafter, the trail steepens again as it keeps heading northeast. 

Eventually, the trail goes through a really steep section but emerges  above two steep gullies (that can be easily seen from most parts of Logan, especially in the winter when they are filled with snow). The trail levels out for the last short section until it disappears as the ridge gets significantly rocky and there is no place for a trail. From here, there are amazing views of Green Canyon, as well as Cache Valley for those who take the time to look around. 

Some people continue along this ridge and connect with other trails further up Green Canyon, but there isn't much of a trail the rest of the way along the ridge because of how rocky it gets in places, so it requires route finding and scrambling to get any farther than is pictured on the map.

8.4,Loop,9098,7492,1675,1680,8,31,Riggs Spring Loop Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.9,"        Most users enjoy the peaceful Riggs Spring Loop Trail as a two-day outing, stopping at one of the 3 backcountry campsites along the way. The Corral Hollow campsite is pleasantly shady but nearby Bullberry Spring is swampy and only useful as a last resort.  Better to camp at Riggs Springs where there are cool groves and a good water source. The Yovimpa Spring campsite lies in a meadow with good views and a nearby water source. 

The preferred direction for navigating the Riggs Spring Loop is counter-clockwise if you want a somewhat more gradual climb out.  From the Rainbow Point parking area, head west following signs towards Yovimpa Pass and Riggs Spring. Descend through forested terrain leaving the chaos and crowds behind. Along the way, you'll approach the edge for great views of pink cliffs and occasional eroded hoodoos. At Yovimpa Pass, you'll see the camping and spring pumphouse in a pretty clearing with aspens and a dirt road entering from the north.  

Drop down from the rim on a very steep section of switchbacking trail that affords good views of the cliffband. Hike beside Podunk Creek through dense stands of ponderosa pines. Arrive at the shady Riggs Spring and campsite. If you're spending the night here, one suggestion is to wake early to catch the sunrise shining on the rim.  

After Riggs Spring, turn sharply to the north and ascend the Mutton Valley drainage heading towards the base of more pink cliffs.  Travel through thick, healthy looking forest. You'll find more solitude and chances for wildlife sightings in this part of the park than near the rim!  At about 5 miles, you reach the Corral Hollow campsite. Continue the traverse, eventually reaching the breezy saddle below the Promontory mesa.

9.2,Point to Point,9403,7441,3117,1155,9,47,Great Western Trail: Big Mountain Pass to Grandview Peak,Difficult,4.0,"        The trail starts at the top of Big Mountain Pass, along state highway 65. The pass has a large parking area with pit toilets, but it is typically crowded on the weekends. This is a very popular mountain biking area, so there is some competition for space.

The trail begins on the other side of the road from the parking lot (where the communication tower is). It starts out going pretty steep up the side of a ridge, with several switchbacks helping you out during the climb. Once you ascend the first 800 feet, the trail levels out and follows a ridge for several miles. There are a few beautiful meadows full of flowers, and some fantastic aspen groves.

There are several small ascents and descents as you follow the main ridgeline. Several portions of the trail connect with ATV trails, so you might run into a little traffic here and there. These are usually people coming up from the East Canyon Resort. There are signs posted everywhere that say keep out of the resort property, so respect the private property.

The trail is well-defined for the most part. There may be a few places here and there that are a bit overgrown, but the trail itself is easy to follow.

In order to climb Grandview peak, you have to leave the trail and descend down a small spur trail. As long as you stay on the ridge the entire way, you won't get lost. The trail to Grandview is difficult to follow in some places, and requires a small bit of scrambling along parts of the ridge, but isn't technical at all.

There isn't a trail for the final few hundred feet, but the route is obvious. The peak has stellar views of the surrounding mountains.

After about 1.8 miles, the trail meets up with the Desolation Trail. You can either go left on a 0.6 mile stretch to Dog Lake and on to one of the many other connected trails in the area, or go right to Desolation Lake. 

The journey to Desolation Lake is not as popular as some others in the area, but I find it peaceful and beautiful. The lake itself isn't very large or incredibly picturesque, but it is quiet and is a good place to relax before heading back down.

Keep an eye out for moose and the occasional deer all along the trail; I have run into three moose here when rounding a corner, so be aware of your surroundings!

1.3,Point to Point,3794,3405,19,389,6,17,Lava Flow Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Snow Canyon is often overlooked. In any other state, where it wasn't overshadowed by the likes of Zion and Bryce Canyon, it would be a national park instead of a state park. But this place is well worth a day trip and is a great place to take kids. This trail runs through a surprisingly vegetated lava field before descending to a wash that parallels the West Canyon Road. The section through the lava field is uneven in places.

1.9,Point to Point,5309,5020,326,37,4,11,Bell Canyon Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        For about 2.5 miles, you'll hike through Bell Canyon. There is only one way to go once you're in the canyon, and you really can't get lost since there will be walls, sometimes hundreds of feet high on either side of you. As you make your way through Bell Canyon, you'll encounter some short rock scrambles up, nothing too high, at most 10-15 ft. at the highest. Take your time as you wind your way through the beautiful, sculpted sandstone walls. Carved over millennia by wind and water, these features are fairly unique to the area. Enjoy!

Little kids and older adults will do fine. Dogs will need assistance. Stagnant pools of cold brown water may be present in a few spots, but it is mainly a dry canyon. 

This trail is generally connected with the Little Wildhorse Canyon Trail to create a loop hike, and the journey is quite popular. You'll most likely meet others on the trail, so please be courteous to your fellow trail users. Because the canyon is dry, you'll want to bring plenty of water for the trip.

The beginning section is easy to follow, with the singletrack usually well worn. After you pass the houses on your left, the trail begins to fade into slick rock and is marked by poorly placed cairns. Keep your eyes peeled for steep inclines and virtually impossible passes.

1.6,Point to Point,9345,7824,1520,0,19,66,Middle Canyon to Butterfield Peaks Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        I happened upon this trail somewhat by accident, so my original route went from the summit back to the parking lot. If starting from the parking lot as mapped, take the trailhead to the right and the trail proceeds through dense forest at a very steep slope.  

Once up on the ridge, hikers will pass through a beautiful alpine meadow filled with wildflowers and incredible views of three valleys: Tooele Valley, Salt Lake Valley, and Utah Valley. Continuing up the trail, as you approach the forested first summit, the trail splits with the main trail continuing on to the right, bypassing the first summit to proceed to the second summit. 

The trail as shown here rises sharply to the left and culminates in a summit with several cell towers and a utility building. From this vantage point, expansive views of the three valleys will make the steep climb worth it.

4.1,Point to Point,5419,5100,482,187,3,26,Wooden Shoe Canyon (Squaw Canyon) Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        From the Squaw Canyon Trailhead at the Squaw Flats campgrounds, you start out heading southeast on the Squaw Canyon Trail by trekking over small knobs with a unsurpassed 360° view of the canyons and snow-capped mountains in the distance for as far as the eye can see. The sandstones many shades of reddish, burgundy, brown and tan start to surround you. You pass through the abundant cottonwood trees, sagebrush, pinyon pine, and ever present reed grasses along the way. 

Keep following the trail southeast for about one mile until you get to the Peekaboo Trail split. Keep right and head southwest to stay on the Squaw Canyon Trail. (Around here we saw lots of mountain lion prints and it smelled of feline urine. Though mountain lions tend to avoid humans at all cost, be aware and keep kids and pets close.) Here the canyons walls begin to swallow and surround you with their magnificent beauty. 

About 3/4 of a mile past the Peekaboo Trail split you come to SQ1 campsite on your right. It's perfectly nestled in the canyon. 

Keep winding your way through the canyon for another 3/4 of a mile and you'll arrive at the Lost Canyon Trail split. Stay right and continue southwest to stay on the Squaw Canyon Trail. Shortly after the Lost Canyon Trail split you'll arrive at SQ2 campsite on your left.

The trail goes through the foothills and winds around Cascade Mountain into Provo Canyon before merging with the Provo River Parkway near Bridal Veil Falls. This trail features great views of Utah Valley and the Provo Canyon. It is a dirt trail, and is not very rugged, but does have some relatively steep climbs that may be difficult for novice hikers. 

In general, the trail is well marked with signs whenever it intersects other dirt trails or roads. Great for getting away from the city and being more in the mountains! A really fun hike that starts right in Provo.

0.5,Point to Point,7306,7127,178,108,11,39,Arches Trail #33075,Intermediate,4.0,"        To reach the trailhead, drive about two miles east on SR 12 from US 89. Before you reach the sign marking the entrance to Red Canyon, there is a road going north marked by a sign for Lossee/Casto. Drive about two miles north to the parking lot for the Lossee Canyon Trail. At the far end of the parking lot, there is a sign for the Arches Trailhead. 

Cross the usually dry stream bed and hike a short distance up the trail to a sign that marks the main loop of the Arches Trail. As always in Red Canyon, there are no signs telling you to stay on the trail, and there will be a trail of use to anywhere you might want to go. 

Turning right at the trail junction, it's only a short distance up to the largest arch on the trail. A trail of use goes under the arch and then steeply up about 50 yards to where you can get a good picture. Return to the main trail, which then winds steeply up an alcove to some of the best rock formations. Just before the trail starts its main descent, there is a short side trail that takes you to a viewpoint.

1.9,Point to Point,5489,4861,630,189,8,27,Post Cutoff Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        Visitors embarking on this trail will either encounter the trailhead from its departure from the Post Trailhead or from its departure from the Lower Muley Twist Canyon Trail as part of the Lower Muley Twist Canyon Hike. Mapped here, the trail leaves from the parking area via a short jaunt on the Halls Creek Drainage. 

After a short warm up, this trail will begin to climb a steep fin of Navajo sandstone. While the tread is mostly good, some visitors may be unsettled by the level of exposure apparent on the ascent. Use caution, but know that the next half mile will be the most difficult portion of the journey, and that the rest of the trail is fairly relaxed. 

As you continue up the first fin, you’ll eventually reach the top. From there, the exposure is significantly less, and you’ll get a respite from the steady incline. You’ll continue moving over the slick rock of the Navajo formation, following regularly spaced cairns that will mark your way. Have no fear when the trail turns to the north, as you’ll avoid a second fin of sandstone before continuing on. 

Soon after passing this second fin, some visitors may be relieved to find themselves at the end of the slick rock and back in a sandy wash. You’ll enjoy rolling terrain from this point to the trail’s end, so be sure to look up and around you once in a while. The route passes through an area rich in fish-hook cacti, and you’ll also see plenty of prickly pear cacti. 

Continue along the sandy wash until nearing the end of the Lower Muley Canyon. This last portion of trail will offer you a bit of thrill as a parting gift, and there will be a bit of exposure, and some steeper slopes just before the trail comes to an end.

4.0,Point to Point,7455,5622,1832,0,9,20,Rick's Canyon Trail #127,Intermediate,4.0,"        To get to Rick's Canyon, you need to go to the Right Hand Fork Trail, follow it for almost half of a mile, and look for a split in the trails. Take the fork to the right and through the small gate and you'll be on the Rick's Canyon Trail.

From the gate, the trail starts to ascend slowly through some grasses and small, scattered junipers. On the right-hand side of the canyon, there are some truly spectacular rock formations forming the mouth of this canyon and they continue for the first few hundred yards near the trail. 

After about another half mile from the fork, there is another fork off (on your left) to the Steel Hollow Trail (another great singletrack from the Right Hand Fork area). From this fork, go to the right and the trail starts to get into Rick's Canyon. The trail follows along the bottom with gradually sloping canyon ridges to either side, and passes in and out of forests and small rock outcroppings. Compared to other canyons around the area, this canyon has very few rock outcroppings but there are some still. 

Soon after the Steel Hollow fork, there is another fork to go to Little Rick's Canyon, although that trail has apparently been abandoned by the forest service after a large avalanche destroyed part of the trail, or at least so I've heard. The trail continues from here toward the head of Rick's Canyon, where the trail starts to steepen and pass through more dense forests and then starts to switchback up towards the top of the canyon where it meets up with the Marie Spring Road.

3.6,Point to Point,7330,6275,1071,726,9,33,Ephraim's Cutoff Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        From the point where the trail breaks off of the Willow Creek Trail, you can see a sign a few yards away. Follow this breakoff as it starts to ascend through a grove of aspens and eventually breaks out into a sagebrush meadow. Soon, the trail reaches a ridge and from here you can get great views of the Bear River Range, including Mount Naomi, Gog, Magog, Mount Elmer, and Mount Beirdneau. 

The trail then starts to ascend part of this ridge before breaking off to contour and ascend up around a drainage until it reaches the adjacent ridge, where the trail ascends again (somewhat steeply in places). The trail on these ridges is clearly marked by large cairns and is really easy to follow. After a while, the trail breaks off of this ridge and descends slightly into the next drainage, where it starts to slowly climb up to the saddle that marks the head of the drainage. 

Not far from where the trail breaks off of the ridge, there is a large, mysterious pit on the left side of the trail. It is a karst sink (or cave) that is at least 10 feet in diameter, and apparently around 120 feet deep (so don't fall in!). It is a unique feature and not easy to miss if you're paying attention, and definitely worth a quick stop to look around in. 

After the sink, the trail ascends slowly up into another forest and then hits the saddle that marks the end of the climbing on this trail. From the saddle, the trail continues through another series of meadows and small forests before dropping onto a brushy hillside. The trail here is quite good as it switches back and forth toward the creek. Eventually, the trail crosses a small creek and then meets up with the Long Hollow road.

3.7,Point to Point,4963,4488,497,384,5,12,Monitor Merrimac Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Start at the enormous parking lot ringed with red boulders (there is camping here, but there are better spots on the nearby roads). Follow the main dirt road  a short ways and you'll come to an intersection with signs indicating ""Mill Road"" and ""Dino Trail"" to the right. You'll exit this way, so for now, stay left on the main road. 

In another tenth of a mile, you'll come to a sign saying ""Halfway Stage Station"" to the right.  You can park here! Take this right turn on a very sandy, smaller road. You are now at the historic Halfway Stage House, and the beginning of the trail, through a gate straight ahead. 

The trail starts with a few short sandy spots but quickly changes to slickrock. You gently hike up remarkably smooth slickrock following white painted markers. Once you reach the end of the enormous bluff you have been hugging on the right, there is a shortcut trail branching to the right. 

Continue hiking over an enormous expanse of slickrock around another huge bluff, and eventually begin heading back north. Now the trail begins a gradual decline over the slickrock.

The slickrock portion of this trail ends at an intersection with the old Monitor Merrimac Jeep Track. From here you may choose to turn back or continue north along the Mill Canyon Dinosaur Trail. If you decide to take the right turn you'll soon on the Mill Canyon Dinosaur Trail, following a dry wash. After a mile or so, you pop out at the end of a road and parking area. 

Take the 150 yard, signposted Dinosaur trail. There really are purple-ish dinosaur fossils and petrified wood (including a cool 2 foot diameter tree trunk!) that you are even permitted touch. 

After that experience, continue to the parking lot where you began, only a couple tenths of a mile up the dirt road.

The trail is a bit hard to follow at night, so you may want to loop back to Woodbriar Way from Wild Rose Park.

As of this writing, an interesting characteristic of the trail are branches that have been placed to prop up trees that the trail bends around. You'll also find some cement blocks with re-bar sticking out of them. Not sure what the history is on that. There's also a spot on the side of the trail near the end where a bunch of hay has been deposited, which suggests it is also a horse route.

Sometimes it's hard to differentiate this trail from the game-trails that spur off from it. Remember all the forks and landmarks for the return or use the Hiking Project mobile app to help stay on track.

You have to do this one in the morning light to see why it's a gem.

It stands isolated and desolate, away from other rock formations.  Its darkened varnish  rock faces are capped by its own slightly overhanging upper reaches.  Dark Angel can be seen from various points in the park including the parking area.  

The Dark Angel Trail leaves from the end of the Devils Garden Main Trail at a signed junction just south of Double O Arch.  The Dark Angel trail is a nearly level out-and-back and easy to follow.

13.2,Point to Point,6875,5727,29,1178,2,9,Dark Canyon West Trail (006),Intermediate,4.0,"        This long, mellow descent starts at the Peavine Corridor Road (089) and ends at the Forest Service / BLM Land Boundary before the Sundance Trail.

From the east, begin hiking past two circular corrals as you leave Peavine Corridor Road (089). Cross a small stream bed and follow it north past sheer cliffs at the edge of Deadman Point. You'll soon arrive at a larger stream bed, which will be your constant companion as you travel through Dark Canyon.

Although you'll cross the stream bed countless times, the trail does its best to minimize the time you'll spend hiking in the wash. Look for frequent sections of singletrack that cut through most bends. 

Along your journey, keep an eye out for small ruins that add scale and history to this already incredible landscape.

Park near Slick Horn Road or along the road leading to the trailhead if you have a low-clearance 2WD vehicle.

The trail starts next to a stock pond and follows a doubletrack road for about 2.7 miles. The views from the trail are very far-ranging and scenic. You occasionally cross slickrock but cairns point the way. When you reach the rim of Grand Gulch you'll be taken by the 300-foot canyon in front of you with Polly's Island in the middle.

As with most trails in Corner Canyon, this trail is well maintained, buffed out singletrack and isn't technically difficult.  This trail is well shaded, so it's popular in the warmer months and gets heavy mountain bike use so you'll want to pay attention for that to avoid any conflicts.

4.3,Point to Point,6918,5470,1606,158,8,25,Rim Overlook/Navajo Knobs Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        The Navajo Knobs Trail and Rim Overlook Trail follow the same route from the intersection with the Hickman Bridge Trail. The Rim Overlook Trail is reached at about the midway point on the longer hike to Navajo Knobs. From the heavily traveled Hickman Bridge Trail, begin climbing along wide Kayenta ledges, often on slickrock. The ascent to the spectacular views at the Rim Overlook is relieved by a few stretches of nearly level ground as the path contours around side drainages.

The four flats before Rim Overlook are pleasant interludes during both the ascent and descent. At the top of the climb, after the first flat, is a close-by exposure of Navajo Sandstone. Following the second flat, the route runs right up a Kayenta ledge at a moderate grade. The way is marked by cairns and the faint remnants of paint. The series of short flats and longer climbs continues for the final mile to to the Rim Overlook.

The overlook offers striking views to east, south, west, and down. The degree to which the latter can be enjoyed depends upon the viewer's tolerance of heights, but anyone can take in the more distant vistas without approaching the cliff edge. In any case, pay attention before moving around - it is a long drop down.

Continuing on to Navajo Knobs, the trail promptly descends 100 ft before beginning a cycle of minor climbs and descents. Two-thirds of a mile from Rim Overlook is the start of a long descent, much of it on slickrock. At the top of the grade, the Knobs come into view of above the Castle.

During the last mile, a moderate climb brings hikers to the Knobs. There are at least two ways up, and cairns may not be of much use here. On top, the lofty perch is large enough to accommodate several people, though some who have difficulty with exposure might not be comfortable there.

There are many places in Capitol Reef that invite long, lingering stays, and Navajo Knobs is definitely near the top of the list as it invites visitors to slowly rotate and enjoy the full viewing circle.

If taking the return to the Hickman Bridge parking area in late afternoon, you'll find good light and many fine views on the way down, and they should be savored not only for their intrinsic value, but also for the rest stops and leisurely pace they encourage.

If choosing the latter, the hike is best as an overnight trip (backcountry permits are required for all overnight trips and can be obtained at the visitor center) or to turn around before the Post Cutoff Trail.

From the trailhead off of Burr Trail Road there are two ways to access this trail. The first is a short but steep slickrock slope connecting to the wash below. The second, less steep option, is to head west along the road for a few hundred feet to the mouth of the wash. The way into the canyon proceeds pleasantly as the wash snakes through the path cut into the Wingate. Several sections of sluice are passed as well as a number of open benches providing good habitat for flowers and shrubs.

Around two miles in, a fine section of short narrows is reached. As the narrows makes its sweeping turn, an interesting dissected pothole can be observed. On the other side of the narrows, a large tributary comes in from the west. This is a good spot to turn around if doing an out-and-back. Continuing to the intersection with the Post Cutoff Trail, the wash passes an assortment of benches and trees, minor undercuts, and varnished walls. This section may have water during, and just after, wet periods.

A section of less-noteworthy canyon follows the cutoff, but things begin to ramp up with beautiful formations and undercuts. Eventually, the canyon walls tower a thousand feet above. At one point, several huge boulders have fallen into the wash, creating a minor obstacle. The easiest route through the rock pile is to stay left of the the first big rock, and climb down over the log through the triangular opening.

Ahead, one of the hike's main attractions appears: Cowboy Cave, an enormous undercut with a sandy bench. The natural hedge of boxelder and Gambel oak that borders the alcove adds to its sanctuary-like appeal. From there, the canyon continues as impressively deep narrows as the drainage slices through the Navajo before reaching the mouth of the canyon and the end of the trail.

Two trails intersect at the canyon’s mouth, the Halls Creek Drainage Trail which heads north to the Post Trailhead, and the Muley Tanks and Hamburger Rocks Spur which is a worthwhile detour to some unique geology and the area’s only reliable source of water (requires treatment).

3.6,Point to Point,6255,5449,948,167,6,13,Wheeler Creek Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        The Wheeler Creek Trail is popular because of it's close proximity to the Ogden area. It is an easier trail built to avoid steep climbs and with a wider trail tread for sharing the trail with bikes and horses.

Wheeler Creek Trail connects Art Nord Trail to Maples Campground just north of Snowbasin Ski Area. The trail travels across the hillside through a variety of trees, shrubs, and mountain wildflowers.

This is why it's more note-worthy as a hike, but you should consider the other said ridges as well for either a return descent, or an alternative ascent, from/to the major junction up above Wild Rose Park.

Always remember to be weary of snakes in tall grass.  Also, I recommend the ankle gators for this trail to keep the pokey weeds out.

0.1,Point to Point,6890,6860,2,31,6,11,Upper Cathedral Valley Overlook,Intermediate,4.0,"        This short trail leading to the overlook heads north from the parking area and rises slightly through many black boulders to the top of a moderately steep slope, where it switchbacks quickly down to cross a sandy swale at the bottom. A very short ascent then leads to a large viewing area with a fine view of Upper Cathedral Valley.

To the north is a line of cathedrals of varying size and shape, and to their right stand some of the best fluted Entrada cliffs in the area. The overlook is above a small buttress that protrudes north toward the cathedrals and which is capped by the white Curtis Formation protecting the softer Entrada below.

Starting from the top of the Town Lift, head uphill for just a few feet then turn left (northeast) to begin a twisty, tight, non-stop descent that feels like you're in deep aspen forests the whole time. To reach town from the end of John's trail, take Sweeney's Switchbacks Trail. You'll frequently get near the rusty historic towers that supported the ore mining carts.  Note: bikes are allowed on this trail.

4.2,Point to Point,10373,9993,642,306,4,10,Lakes Country Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Starting at the Crystal Lake Trailhead, you’ll continue past the Crystal Lake and Cliff Lake turnoffs and cross a small creek before turning west along the flank of Haystack Mountain. 

A series of switchbacks takes you up and over the saddle between Haystack Mountain and Mount Watson to the north. From here, you’ll descend and pass a spur that can take you to Marjorie and Weir Lakes, but this trail continues on past Long Lake. 

After crossing the outlet, you’ll come to a rocky section where you can lose the trail if you’re not careful. About a mile past Long Lake, you’ll arrive at another spur that can take you to Duck Lake, but continue on and the next section is a short, steep climb up to Island Lake. 

You can connect here to trails that actually continue on far beyond to Smith and Morehouse Reservoir, but the Lakes Country Trail ends here.

5.4,Point to Point,10723,8216,2565,428,10,38,Skyline Trail (015),Difficult,4.0,"        Journey along the Skyline Trail (015) to experience a truly classic piece of Manti-La Sal National Forest.

While it's possible to hike this trail from either trailhead, taking the trail from west to east (as mapped) provides you with the novelty of experiencing increasingly more beautiful panoramic views the farther along you travel. In order to prevent retracing your steps to your start area, park a shuttle vehicle or bicycle at the opposite end before starting your journey.

Starting at its western end near a pull-off, follow the trail as it begins what will define the remainder of the trip: steady climbing along exposed ridgelines that tout exceptional, 360° views of the surrounding area. While sweating it out on the moderate-but-sustained climbing on this trail, be sure to take plenty of breaks and enjoy the sheer beauty of your surroundings. If you're out trekking through the wilderness, there's a good chance time is not of the essence - so enjoy yourself! 

About four miles into the trail, your efforts will finally have culminated in reaching the high point of the ridgeline. From this point, high-five your hiking buddy, whether they be friend or Fido, and continue on the trail knowing that all your climbing is done. From here on out, the trail continues downhill through peaceful alpine meadows to its end at the Shay Ridge Trail (162) near FS Rd 0354.

2.9,Point to Point,8000,7702,655,359,7,20,Lewis Peak Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        The trail starts out as a rolling traverse but ends with an overall grind to Lewis Peak. Before the grind to Lewis Peak, there are a couple of side trails that head to the top of two hills. You can get around them by staying on the main trail.  

There's a hard right at about the halfway point. There is a sign, but it has been propped in a pile of rocks and is down at times. Keep your head up as there are some spots where the trail washes out off the edge.  

From Lewis Peak, you can see Ogden Valley to the east and can see for miles to the west.

7.0,Point to Point,5999,5189,1178,471,4,31,Sheets Gulch,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        From the Sheets Gulch Parking Area, work your way south on the obvious path that crosses a low divide, drop into Sheets Gulch, and head southwest (right). There may be a little standing water or wet sand at the start, but the wash will soon dry up. The first 1.25 miles to a canyon junction (stay right or west) is open and flat, with scattered cottonwoods and tamarisk. The canyon then tightens to a good narrows section that includes a short, shallow, and sinuous slot with minor chockstones. About 2.25 miles from the road, visitors will encounter a good 500-foot long slot that eventually ends at angled walls.

Until it is rearranged by the next big flood, Sheets Gulch is easy going, with alternating stretches of narrows and slightly wider, but still deep and impressive gorges. At places, the Navajo is eroded into steep, sweeping slopes. Exposed pieces of black petrified wood from the Chinle Formation are increasingly common farther up Sheets Gulch. The slots are generally a little less impressive after the initial group, but are still interesting, with enough chockstones blocking the path to provide some upper body exercise.

At the 4.5-mile mark, an easy 8-foot high boulder is, as of this writing, a minor obstacle. A third of a mile beyond, the character of Sheets Gulch changes quite dramatically. The canyon curves to the right (northwest) and the floor widens and straightens, but the most noticeable difference is the appearance of Douglas firs on the south wall.

The next two miles are mellow and easygoing, but they do make the round trip almost 14 miles, which is a very long day for many. The scenery is good, especially in the sheer Wingate Sandstone, but there is no shame in turning around before fatigue turns a nice outing into a forced march.

As mapped, Sheets Gulch extends for 7 miles one way, but the early turnaround point is indicated with an information symbol.

3.3,Point to Point,9867,6549,3318,117,20,51,Oak Grove Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        This is a steep trail that quickly changes between two main ecosystems - a dusty reddish desert where the trail crosses ephemeral stream drainages and passes desert foliage, and then the trail slowly crosses over into a lush pine forest with wildflowers and occasional leftover snowbanks in the summer. The switchbacks that cut into this steep mountainside were constructed a long time ago, but have been very well kept up and the trail is easy to follow.

Initially the trail starts ascending slowly, as it leaves the Oak Grove campground and starts up a small drainage. The trail then breaks away from this drainage and heads for a steep ridge that leads up into the heart of the Pine Valley mountains. At this point, the switchbacks begin, but so do the great views. Looking back to the east one can start to see the Colorado Plateau and red rock formations in the distance. 

These views just keep getting better as the trail ascends and allows for more uninterrupted views of the area, and eventually one can even see down into St. George and parts of the red rocks of Snow Canyon State Park. There are also some impressive granite cliffs just above and along the trail itself, within the Pine Valley Mountains, and the trail passes by some huge granite boulders as well that have fallen from the cliffs. 

Eventually the trail reaches its apex and drops down into a lush evergreen forest with plenty of shade and ends up meeting up with the Summit Trail that can go either toward Signal Peak or toward other sections of the Pine Valley Mountains.

It breaks out into semi-desert territory and begins to climb for quite a while - enjoy the wide open views and of the pine and aspen forests covering the Abajos.

Eventually, you head back into forest for a rocky stretch of trail. Though the trail doesn't climb or descend much here, it will take some time to navigate the rocks.

You'll hit the Robertson Pasture Trail, which you can take to a high saddle point (10,500') between Twin Peaks. This trail soon ends where it ingloriously hits a dirt road.

The trail to the lake is rocky and steep, and frequently wide enough for two hikers to hike side by side. Be sure to hike around the lake to see the old historic cabin.

The trail was cut into the hillside and is in great shape. In the fall, the scrub oak and other vegetation turn beautiful colors and make this into a beautiful trail. 

The trail ascends through a few small drainages, and then around the front of a steep ridge, and at this point the climbing stops and the trail levels out and before long reaches the Bridger Lookoff, which is a simple clearing with great views in all directions. To the south is Mill Hollow, a large drainage that drains the avalanche chutes below Logan Peak. To the north is a tall set of cliffs across the canyon, and to the east and west flows the Logan River and Logan Canyon.

5.2,Point to Point,4295,3777,578,60,2,7,Dead Ringer,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        Dead Ringer is a trail in the Hurricane Cliffs Trail network completed in 2015.  It was built with a partnership between the Dixie Mountain Bike Trails Association and the BLM. The trail was named for the remains of a long passed cow that was found while scouting this trail. She was pretty much just bones, but still had the cowbell around her neck.  

Dead Ringer provides an easy climb up to the JEM parking lot. The climb is possible due to a very long bench trail built at 6% grade. It's a great climb, but also a fun descent. The long bench cut into the steep mesa is a great section of trail. There are two trail splits that offer hard or easy descents. Dead Ringer has it all; great views, easy climbing, and a smooth and easy downhill. By itself, it's an out-and back trail, but can be combined with JEM Trail or Goulds Rim trail to make loops over 20 miles.  

There is 2-way traffic, and a few blind corners on the bench section.  The bench is narrow with limited space to pass, so check your speed, and keep your eyes open.

2.0,Point to Point,3295,3127,83,175,2,23,Dino Cliffs Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        The best way to hike this is from north to south. To get there from Church Rocks, drop down the last long slickrock section on Church Rocks (going south) stay right and veer up the wash (west). Branch off of Church Rocks and climb the relatively steep hill to the left (south). This is a short Prospector Trail connector. After cresting the hill, turn left at the intersection and then right down the south side of the hill. About halfway down the hill, look for the singletrack that branches to the right. It climbs onto a sandstone ledge. Follow this for about a half mile and then cross a doubletrack. 

Look for the Dino Cliffs sign and singletrack that climbs the hill across the road. Follow this trail for about a mile and you'll see a short connector trail that continues straight (which is now marked ""closed""). Turn right and try your skill climbing the sandy hill. Look for the dinosaur tracks on the slickrock in the wash bottom before the sandy hill. There are a few short but difficult sections.

1.7,Point to Point,6365,5798,567,209,9,27,Bicentennial Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        The Bicentennial Trail can be taken in both directions, and either way, you'll have an equal amount of steep climbing to keep your heart pounding. To get to each end of the trail, you'll need to climb on the North Fork River Trail or Cutler Creek Trail, which are both jeep trails.

For more miles, you have a choice of parking either at the northern Mule Shoe Trail parking lot, just below it down the North Fork Park Rd, or at the main northeast North Fork Park campgrounds. 

For less jeep road hiking, I prefer parking at the main northeast North Fork Park campgrounds and climbing up the North Fork River Trail. From the main campgrounds, follow the jeep road to the left and make your way around the metal gate. After a few hundred yards, take the trail on the left to start the long steep climb up the Bicentennial Trail. At mile .71, you'll reach the junction of the Middle Link Trail, which is a great shortcut that will take you back down to the North Fork River Trail.

Continue straight on the trail to climb up to the top at mile 1.28. Then you start the descent on the Bicentennial Trail until you cross the Cutler Flat Trail junction on the right side at mile 1.46. Continue straight downhill until you have to cross Cutler Creek. Watch out for shin deep water and big river rocks as you make your way first to the sandbar and then across the rest of the water before making your way up the side banks. 

After drying your soggy socks and shoes, proceed to the left until you merge with the Cutler Creek Trail (jeep trail). For the next .25 mile down the jeep trail, there might be quite an overflow from the creek making it wet and muddy. 

Once you've made your way through the swampy jeep road, you'll start climbing a hill to get to the northwest bowery and campgrounds. Shortly down the jeep trail, you'll see the Cutler Spring Trail that will connect with the Ben Lomond Trail. Staying straight on the Cutler Creek Trail will end at the other parking area below and turning right up North Fork Park road to lead to the northern Mule Shoe and Mule Ear trailhead and parking lot. 

To get back to your car, go straight on North Fork Park road and stay left to get back to the main northeast North Fork Park campgrounds.

7.9,Loop,4766,4486,289,284,1,12,Bar-M Loop,Easy,4.0,"        With some 4 wheel drive road, some doubletrack and even some slickrock, this loop makes for a great outing for families and beginners, and is an easy introduction to the Moab area.

The loop travels over rolling desert terrain, with long views into Arches National Park to Balanced Rock, the Windows and the Klondike Bluffs.

This loop can be done in either direction, but this description is for the clockwise loop:

From the Moab Brand area parking lot, go west along the access road, turning right when you hit the fence. Follow this gravel road north past the exit to 191 as it turns into a 4 wheel drive road.

After 1.75 miles, the trail branches off to the right and curls around to head southwest, soon passing the head of lower Sevenmile Canyon. It's definitely worth stopping to check out the views down into the canyon from this impressive pour-off.

Continue south along the doubletrack as it hugs the edge of the slickrock, passing the 4-way junction with North 40 and Circle-O, then the southern spur to Circle-O and Rockin' A. This is the most engaging section of the trail, weaving back and forth between dirt and slickrock surface. Almost 4 miles beyond the pouroff, the trail reaches another 4WD road and turns nearly 180 degrees to follow this road 1.2 miles to the Moab Canyon Paved Path.

This basically marks the end of the hike; follow the path north for a mile then take a right onto to the access road back to the parking lot.

Many trails enter and exit at various points in the loop, creating endless options to extend it into a longer or more challenging hike. Junctions are signed to aid with navigation, but keep in mind that these signs can be very small and discreet.

3.9,Point to Point,10171,8866,283,1443,8,34,Tushar Ridge Trail #176,Intermediate,4.0,"        Eagle Point provides a reservable shuttle that will pick users up from HWY 153, just past the Three Creek Reservoir. To learn more or to set up a shuttle call: 435-438-3612. Alternatively you can leave a leave a car at the Three Creek Reservoir turnout.

Tushar Ridge begins off of the Puffer Lake Trail and heads into rolling terrain through a thick forest. This section is a Forest Service, non-motorized trail, so the trees have been cut tightly around the trail corridor to discourage ATVs. Watch out for brush and creeping juniper which can cause some itchy shins. The trail continues to wind through the trees until it reaches HWY 153.

Cross over and head into the Eagle Point Resort property. This portion of the trail follows a ski run (there may be maintenance vehicles during the summer). There's a good climb to the top of the Surface Lift. At the lift, the trail switches to singletrack as it alternates between trees and ski runs. Make sure to keep close to the tree line on your left as the trail follows the ridge past after the last run.

Back in the trees, you'll enjoy more singletrack. There is one marked branch-off trail, and hikers should keep to the right at this split. Shortly thereafter, Tushar Ridge trail turns north to run through a small meadow. On the other side, it returns to the trees as the fun descent continues. At the bottom, cross the bridge over the creek and follow the trail toward HWY 153.

Here you can pick up your car, enjoy a reservable shuttle (if you arranged it in advance from Eagle Point), hike this as an out-and-back, or you'll need to climb up HWY 153 back to the parking area a few miles above.

3.2,Point to Point,3430,3044,425,217,4,9,Rim Rock Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        From the Sand Cove trailhead, Rim Rock Trail starts as doubletrack heading SE. The doubletrack switchbacks right and drops down into Sand Cove wash. There is a technical ledgy spot about half way down the hill. Drop into the wash, stay left and then climb the hill on the singletrack to your south (right). At the top of the climb it becomes doubletrack again. Follow this doubletrack keeping right at the junctions. Don't get discouraged by the doubletrack. There is a lot of great singletrack coming.  This will lead you to a fence crossing. After crossing the fence take the singletrack trail heading west and follow the signs. There are a lot of intersections with other trails but they are all well marked.  Simply follow the signs around the lollipop loop and back to the trailhead. This trail is a little less technical than Barrel Roll, but there is more climbing because the trail drops into the wash and climbs out twice.

The trail is mostly a firm coarse sandy soil with large rounded rocks. It is  a great trail if other local trails are too muddy. This trail can be done in either direction, but clockwise is the most fun.

6.7,Point to Point,10016,8833,2317,1603,11,41,Nebo Bench Trail #8117,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        There is nothing quite like verdant summer in the Wasatch mountains. It just smells good! And here on a weekday at least, you can largely have it to yourself. Peak baggers will take the nearby North Peak Trail but if you want something easier or are bringing children, the Nebo Bench Trail has much to offer and may be just as beautiful.

The trail is largely flat but starts with a drop through aspens to cross Left Fork Salt Creek. Most sections are easy hiking but there are short slippery sections that merit the int/diff rating and make hiking boots preferable. 

After gaining the bench 1.6 miles in, you are afforded a long stretch of excellent views. We turned back after 3.0 miles at the closest approach to the Mt. Nebo where narrow traverses of steep scree fields proved the limit of my wife's tennis shoes, but I've included the whole trail to where it intersects the Nebo Peak Trail. 

From the 3.0 mile mark the trail switchbacks dramatically to gain about 450 feet before losing it over the next 1.5 miles, with yet another climb to finish around 9940 feet.

With plenty of rocks, this trail will definitely test your balance.

3.0,Point to Point,9375,7858,1518,2,10,22,Forest Service Road 193 - South,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        After splitting off from Forest Road 008, this road heads toward a series of switchbacks as it heads up the mountain in the direction of American Fork Twin Peaks. The trail bobs in and out of aspen and pine forests and starts out low enough to hear the creek that feeds Silver Lake Flat, but pretty soon it gets high enough to where you can no longer hear it. 

This road is in pretty good shape, and in general doesn't get too rocky, although there are a couple of rocky sections and there is generally an erosional rut in the middle of the road (which can be pretty easily avoided on either side of the road). The switchbacks on the road are generally bermed on the sides, which makes it great for hiking down. 

After the series of switchbacks, the road comes to a closed gate as it enters Major Evans Gulch (private property). It is uncertain whether the land owner wants hikers or runners on the property, so for now the route ends at this gate, even though the forest service road continues beyond the gate.

But lo, what a beautiful oasis of cascading waterfalls, pools, and vegetation. More than 7 million gallons of water flows through Cascade Spring each day.

Arguably, this is most family friendly trail in Utah, easily doable with babies and toddlers in tow. Wooden boardwalks and bridges make it easy to push a stroller around the loop. It's even certified ADA-accessible.

Cascade Spring suffered in 2003 from a prescribed burn in the area that escaped the planned burn area but happily it recovered well.

Once at the junction, continue up the North Fork River Trail and stay straight at 0.13 miles for more jeep trail climbing. At mile 0.32, you'll see two buildings in a gated ranch to the right but continue straight ahead and start the singletrack through the trees. 

The initial singletrack climb has deep ruts that make you feel like a ball in a pinball machine. Once it's time to start descending, the smooth trail under trees will challenge you with big roots and logs that make it hard. 

After fighting through the forest, the trail will drop you in the meadow before a gentle climb, eventually merging with Bicentennial Trail.

The top of this trail (west end) follows along an old jeep route for about a half-mile before it turns to singletrack. At this point the trail takes on the familiar characteristics of others in the area; a twisting route over a mix of hard-pack, rock and some sandy sections. This trail does have a little more sand than others but it is never for very far, just be mindful of the soft corners. 

There are a few sets of rugged switchbacks over a couple ridges that can be a challenge. 

As with most all of the other trails in this area the views of the surrounding geology are spectacular, this trail however is rugged enough you'll surely want to keep an eye on it.

The trail itself is a short, intermediate skill level ride. Starting at its junction with the Big Mesa Trail, the trail quickly climbs up into the pinions mixed with slickrock patches. A huge expanse of slickrock on the north-facing slope is a fun distraction from the climb, just be mindful of the edge. 

The trail across the slickrock here isn’t always slick - it’s rather rough and somewhat of a challenge in places. Once on top, the trail becomes a spinning but fast ride to and across UT313 and another half mile until it ends at the Coney Island Trail.

You start heading east up a canyon, with red cliffs on both sides. There is a creekbed that runs alongside much of the trail. The farther you go up the canyon, the more vegetation you start to see. 

The trail narrows at the end, and it becomes a little difficult to follow, but if you stay next to the creek at the very, very end, you'll make it to the waterfall. It is a nice 35-foot drop.

10.6,Point to Point,6344,5554,837,57,2,16,The Gulch (Upper),Intermediate,4.0,"        This trail explores The Gulch north of Burr Trail Road. It starts to follow the wash along boot-worn paths on benches to the left and right. Throughout the second half of the trail, you'll mostly navigate through the streambed. The trail is very scenic with impressive canyon walls throughout. 

From the parking lot, take the sandy path north and cross Long Canyon. There is a cow fence right on the other side. Stay on the east bench of the wash. After about 0.5 miles, Steep Creek enters on the left. You'll have to cross the wash before that and then jump across the creek. From this point on, the trail regularly crosses the wash, and it's not always easy to find the trail on the other side. You can also work your way through the streambed until you find the next section of the trail. The canyon narrows a bit further upstream offering a little shade on a hot day.

At 1.3 miles, you reach a pour-off that you can bypass on the left via a narrow sandy path up to a bushy bench with an old wire fence. The canyon widens after that. After a little over 4 miles, Water Canyon joins on the left. Depending on the season, there may not be water in The Gulch beyond that.

The going from here is easy and pleasant. Two major side canyons open on the right at 6 miles and 7 miles. At 8.2 miles, a prominent side canyon joins on the left – this is the access to Lamanite Arch. Keep following the wash to remain in The Gulch. After this point, the canyon becomes continually wider. While you could continue up the wash all the way into the Boulder Mountains, most people stop where the boot trail disappears near the 8.8 mile mark. With relative ease, those who wish to continue (or have pre-planned a shuttle) can follow this wash slightly farther to its intersection with BLM Road 126 (as mapped).

1.0,Point to Point,5419,4753,667,19,13,30,Yellow Rock Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        The old horse trail that goes up this route is so eroded that this has essentially become a steep, off-trail adventure, which requires some scrabbling and route-finding skills. However, it is well-known and commonly traveled. A few cairns help indicate the right route.

The hike starts from an unmarked parking area on Cottonwood Canyon Road, about 14 miles north of US 89. Yellow Rock cannot be seen from the road, so the easiest way to know where to start is to go to the Hackberry Canyon parking area, which does have a sign, and then drive back (south) 0.2 miles, just past a dirt road that heads off to the east. 

The trail/route goes up a short, steep canyon directly across from the parking spot. To reach it, find a trail of use through the brush and cross Cottonwood Creek. Much of the year, the creek is a shallow stream that you have to wade across, but it is usually dry in the summer.  

Shortly after you start up the canyon, you should see an eroded trail climbing steeply up a ravine to the right. The way up is not too difficult to follow, but try to remember exactly how you climb, because it is easier to take the wrong way when coming back down. When you reach a high point where you can see Yellow Rock, go a little to the left and then follow a very shallow canyon. Once you are on the rock, you can go anyway that you want. The south side has more colors and textures.

The broad, flat summit has sweeping views in all directions. There are other colorful rocks in the area, including  a summit rock to the southwest that looks like a castle.

2.2,Point to Point,9968,8771,1197,973,19,49,Cardiff Pass Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.8,"        The beginning of this trail actually starts on a paved road past some residences but pretty quickly turns into a pretty rough, rocky dirt road that climbs quickly toward Cardiff Pass. The road appears to be an abandoned mining road with all of the loose rock that covers it in places, but in many places the trail is pretty decent. As the trail gets higher, it gets somewhat steeper (after about 3/4 mile) until it comes out into a small, pretty meadow where the trail more or less levels out briefly, and then starts to ascend steeply again. The last few yards are a sort of scramble as the trail crosses over some rock before reaching Cardiff Pass. From Cardiff Pass, the Mt. Superior Trail can be taken to Mount Superior and Monte Cristo, two great peaks along the Cottonwood Ridgeline. 

Another option from Cardiff Pass is to cross over the ridge and descend down into Mill D South. This is a similarly steep and rocky trail, but appears to be less frequently used as the trail can be hard to follow at times. However, the views all around in this beautiful canyon make up for the confusion. The trail generally trends to the west and above the natural drainage in the canyon but crosses a few of the ephemeral streams on its way down. 

About 3/4 of a mile down, the trail descends down close to the main drainage and follows it for a short distance until it meets up with an old mining road and then follows that road down until it passes by an old mining site and meets up with the main Mill D South Fork Road.

5.2,Point to Point,4019,3628,118,437,2,12,Wiregrass Canyon,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        Wiregrass Canyon is one of many side canyons that drain into Lake Powell on the Colorado River. This hike winds its way along a desert wash. The first mile of canyon provides a range of scenery, as the path first follows the sandy bottom and then climbs up to a viewpoint. Below, the canyon narrows into a steep, narrow slot. Rock cairns mark a path around the slot so you can continue hiking on the other side.

This can make a good turn around point, but keep walking and you'll pass through some natural bridges, see balanced rocks, and find little nooks and crannies to explore on the trek to the lake. The canyon walls provide a fascinating glimpse into the geological history of the area. The rock is eroded in intricate patterns that will have you guessing at what forces created such interesting works of art.

The closer you get to the lakeshore, the more mud you'll encounter. Be prepared to go barefoot or lose your shoes in the deep, thick mud! The end of the canyon can also get very brushy and nearly impossible to get through. But if the conditions are right and you have enough determination, you'll end up at the marshy lakeshore where you'll see nothing but sparkling blue water, tons of birds and scraggly marsh plants. This is no swimming beach, but there is a place to sit on the rock and enjoy some peace and quiet before returning the way you came. - Contributed by Jessica Beauchemin, Outdoor Project

2.5,Point to Point,5803,5583,104,225,3,16,Jailhouse Rock/Temple Rock Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.8,"        A short hike to the overlook for Jailhouse Rock winds gently down an old road. Beyond the overlook, the road descends steeply through wildly eroded rock and then disappears on the valley floor. Eventually, visitors will pick up a lightly used hiker-made trail that passes just north of Jailhouse Rock and continues on to the top of an eroding volcanic dike and beyond to a viewpoint close to Temple Rock. 

Comprised of Entrada Sandstone bases covered by more resistant Curtis Formation caprock, both Jailhouse Rock and Temple Rock are superb examples of how such a simple difference in a rock's susceptibility to weathering can drive the formation of such dramatically stunning monoliths in the middle of the Utah desert. While the faint path continues into the desert, the real stars of the hike are Temple Rock and Jailhouse Rocks. 

You can continue further, but it won't much enhance your journey. Once you've gone as far as you'd like, simply turn around and return the way that you came.

After gaining this peak, the trail becomes a beautiful ridge hike on a shattered quartzite trail that can be somewhat hard to follow at times, but the ridge is easy enough to follow and it doesn't make much difference whether you're hiking on the trail or cross country. 

At this point, you can finally see the Twin Peaks, and they are not rugged but still majestic in their own way. The trail drops down to a saddle before making the final push to the eastern summit. From the eastern summit, you can finally really see the Cottonwood ridge and down into Little Cottonwood Canyon, as well as the ski resorts and the views of Timpanogos and down into American Fork Canyon are incredible as well. 

After taking in the views, you can then take the faint trail/cross country route up to the taller West Twin, which offers view of Lone Peak, Coalpit Gulch, the Pfeifferhorn, and many of the other incredible peaks along the ridge above Little Cottonwood Canyon. The route between the Twin Peaks involves a slight amount of descent, and then a fun, short ascent.

6.8,Point to Point,4980,3025,26,1981,6,17,Icehouse Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        The Icehouse Trail itself is six miles of almost non-stop downhill, descending 2000 vertical feet. There are occasional very short gentle climbs to keep you honest. Intermittent pumice boulders situated in the trail surface would be a pain to stumble on. The final 1/3-mile plunges off the mesa is more rugged and a little steep at times. 

Those who want to earn their vertical -- or who don't have a shuttle -- can hike up Cottonwood Road for an 18-mile loop (uff!) or you can hike this as an out-and-back.

It might be wise to use the Hiking Project mobile app on this one. The start is very difficult to find, and there are no signs above the Broken Mesa/Icehouse trail junction. It is also very easy to lose the trail in the upper sections. Beware that this appears to be a user-created trail, and mostly goes directly down the fall line, which means that it has become a watercourse and is now (in 2016) a rutted rocky experience. This trail would be greatly improved and more sustainable with reroutes off the fall line, which would be a huge project.

1.4,Point to Point,8365,7924,443,5,6,14,Baby Thunder Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        From the split with the White Pine-Snowbird Link, the Baby Thunder Trail heads up a series of switchbacks that traverses through small forests and open slopes within the Snowbird ski resort. In the first couple of switchbacks, in the more forested section are a few fun plywood cutouts (off the trail) of mining buildings or hotels and things that make this trail fun and unique. The trail crosses some small streams and wet areas, but generally has some sort of foot bridge (or at least a pallet) to keep you from getting muddy or messing up the trail. Most of the trail, however, is pretty dry and somewhat rocky but still very manageable and fun for the ascent and descent. After the trail runs across a small ridge, it slowly drops down until it meets up with Rothman Way, just underneath the Gadzoom ski lift.

15.4,Point to Point,5072,4668,466,698,1,15,Chute of Muddy Creek,Difficult,4.0,"        The Chute of Muddy Creek is an approximately 15-mile route from trailhead to trailhead that will require a 16-mile car shuttle. Much of the route is comprised of wading in Muddy Creek between steep and narrow canyon walls. 

Begin at the Tomsich Butte Trailhead. Proceed downstream from the Tomisch Butte Trailhead. After two miles you'll encounter Penitentiary Canyon on your left. After you pass Penitentiary Canyon the canyon walls begin to narrow. The creek becomes significantly deeper and you may have to wade up to your waist at this point, depending on the time of year. 

Approximately five miles after you pass Penitentiary Canyon, you'll encounter Music Canyon on your left. I recommend using the Music Canyon Route and scrambling up the beautifully sculpted, narrow slot to Music Canyon. Go up as high as you feel comfortable until you are eventually cliffed-out by a large dry fall. Return back down the slot to Muddy Creek. 

Continue downstream for 4.25 miles until you pass Chimney Canyon on your right. From the mouth of Chimney Canyon proceed 1.5 miles downstream to the mouth of Mud Canyon on your left. Proceed another 1.5 miles downstream from Mud Canyon and you'll encounter an obvious trail on your left. Follow this trail for 0.5 miles to the Hidden Splendor Airstrip.

Follow the narrowing canyon upstream for a third of a mile. The trail heads up the rocky slope and crosses a beautiful line of reddish needles. Continue through the basin on the other side and make your way around the needles at 0.8 miles. The trail turns south now and skirts the outline of a beautiful stretch of needles. Far reaching views are to the east to the La Sal Mountains and to the north to Junction Butte and Grand View Point. Follow the path as it hugs the needles for about 2 miles where you reach the trail that leads to Chesler Park.

Keep left to stay on the trail. After half a mile, you descend into Elephant Canyon with its wide wash. Cross the wash and head up straight on the other side. The trail ascends quickly leading to a spectacular slot, a shady and cool place on this mostly exposed trail. As you exit the slot, the trail turns right and heads up a grassy prairie framed by a wall of needles on the right. Cross another smaller set of needles at about 3.8 miles. You can now see the prominent Elephant Hill straight ahead. Continue on the slightly descending trail towards another set of smaller rocks. Once you have passed them, views across the plateau are abundant. Follow the cairned path and leave Elephant Hill to your left.

7.0,Point to Point,8957,8571,778,831,4,13,Josephite Point Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Proceed to the southeast side of Pete's Hole Reservoir. You'll find the trailhead just beyond a picnic table. Prepare for 6.8 miles of delightful singletrack, well worth hiking if you're in the area (Price, Ephraim, or I-70 between Salina and Green River). Getting to the trailhead can be a challenge if not in a high-clearanace four-wheel drive vehicle. But a two-wheel drive SUV should be able to make it okay. 

This trail is part of the Great Western Trail (Utah Section) and is signed accordingly, with markers resembling those for the Pacific Crest Trail (See  expeditionutah.com/featured…). It has the high-elevation feel of some of the trails around Gunnison and Crested Butte.

Overall this is a fairly easy hike. The first couple of miles are mostly smooth and mostly descend. About a third of the way in there are a few roots and rocky sections, though nothing challenging, and a short moderate climb. There are a few partly overgrown segments.

In about four miles, near Josephite Point, the trail turns south. At this point the trail may become hard to follow, so look for the Great Western Trail marker posts to guide you. The trail shows evidence of being used for horses or packstock in this area; it's heavily divoted in places.

There's a short moderate final climb that takes one to Mary's Lake. When you reach the Mary's Lake trailhead, it's about 500 feet to the lake itself. Beware of mosquitoes at the otherwise pleasant lake.

4.8,Point to Point,5224,3903,349,1632,8,35,Lower Red Lake Canyon Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        A number of access points will get you to the Lower Red Lake Canyon Trail, but the quickest is by way of the Elephant Hill Road (4WD). By foot or wheel, follow this busy 3.7-mile road to where it ends at Devils Lane Road.

Millions upon millions of years ago, as sea levels in the area dropped, a thick layer of sandstone covered the evaporated salt left behind. As red sand and silt were deposited by rain and snowmelt, white sand also blew in, forming dunes. These geologic processes are still on display today in the alternating bands of red and white rock throughout Canyonlands, and especially in the Needles.

During a period of tectonic unrest, these evaporated salt layers were pulled towards the Colorado River, causing valleys (known as grabens) to collapse. From the 4x4 road, the Lower Red Lake Canyon Trail leaves the Devil's Lane graben to transect a horst - a raised fault block thrown upwards between two grabens. 

With a bit of easy scrambling, the trail reaches a high point on the horst. From here, views of the Devil's Lane graben widen below you. Turning west, the route drops down into a sunken wash and winds toward the western edge of the horst, where soon you'll be able to see the length of the Cyclone Canyon graben. Quickly loosing 250 feet, the trail meets with the Cyclone Canyon Trail. 

Entering one last horst, the trail funnels into Lower Red Lake Canyon. The name—Red Lake—could in part lend itself to the red sandstone, but it’s a misleading title as I saw no lake in sight whatsoever. 

Scrambling onto the sidewall of the deep gorge first, a well-maintained trail threads the rugged terrain to bypass an impassable pour-off, then descends slowly into the sandy wash. The grade abates, and the trail marches steadily downhill toward the Colorado River. Dwarfed by the towering walls, the wide vistas of the Needles disappear, and the first glimpse at the water doesn’t come until the wash empties at the shoreline. 

Across the river, you might notice a flat, sandy plain, seemingly out of place among the sheer cliffs surrounding much of the rest of Cataract Canyon. It's known as Spanish Bottom, an ancient sinkhole of collapsed rock.

This is a very new trail, and it's very easy to follow and has low traffic. The first quarter-mile is doubletrack that parallels a sandy wash before it crosses through it for a few hundred yards to reach the singletrack portion of the lollipop loop. Ahead, the trail is pretty straightforwards, but there are two potentially unclear points detailed below.

If you hike the trail counter-clockwise (as mapped), there are a few small switchback and a potentially confusing turn 0.6 miles in. The eastern edge of the trail has been lined with rocks to keep you from turning to the right (the wrong direction). Continuing counter-clockwise, there is a fork in the trail at 1.25 miles. If you go right, there is a Alternate Line with very small technical section that is more of a mountain bike section with a few drops and rocks that you have to jump over or off of. If instead you go left, it continues as an easy trail. Both directions reconnect to each other after less than 30 or 40 yards.

At about two miles into the trail, you'll approach Will Gilbert Point. There's a sign with a bench which folds down into a table. It faces southwest and is a great place to sit and relax, eat a snack, etc. At 2.5 miles, you'll complete the circle and can head right to return to the the trailhead.

After passing the cutoff trail, you hit a lot of switchbacks heading up to the overlook - an optional out and back. The hike down is shady again and this is the section that I've seen moose most frequently so keep an eye out. About 30 feet from the road and parking, you'll see the cutoff I mentioned earlier crossing your path. Turning left would take you to the Cutler Basin Trail up to Ben Lomond.

4.3,Point to Point,5813,4860,1000,676,7,39,Bonneville Shoreline to Coldwater Canyon - North Ogden,Difficult,4.0,"        A climber's delight, this section of trail is the newest addition to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail, known as the 'BST.'  It appears this trail was finished in the spring of '15.  

You can start at North Ogden Nature Center Trailhead and climb the old jeep trail up to the BST. It's well-marked and fairly obvious. However, this area can see a lot of traffic.  When you get to the trail, head north.  

The first 1/2 mile is fairly rugged. Once you round the corner at the first small canyon (Garner Canyon), stay right and pass over a small bridge (taking the small rocky trail on the left will take you to a canal service road, and you'll have to make a short climb back to the trail).  Climb the 2 switchbacks, and follow the trail for as far as you want to go.  Once you get into the southern entrance of Coldwater Canyon, prepare yourself for a steep, exposed and loose narrow trail. 

After almost all the climbing, you'll reach the eastern end of the canyon and see a pump station on your left and a service road on your right.  I suppose you could bail here, but you've worked hard to get this far... I recommend climbing a little further so you can enjoy a little more of the downhill!  The northern side of the canyon is wider and proves an easier climb out.  

Did I mention the views? They're stunning!  You'll climb through several canyons.  They're a great place to cool off, and one might even have water coming down.  The higher you go, the more stunning the views become...  Willard Peak and Ben Lomond Peak are begging to be photographed!

Getting back to the car is easy - a quick hike down Mountain Road will put you right where you started.  Or, you could just hike the trail back to your car!

3.8,Point to Point,5916,5552,13,376,2,5,Pleasant Creek Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        The Pleasant Creek trail follows a hiker-made route through a pretty canyon. The perennial stream must be crossed many times — usually by hopping from rock to rock. The route also traverses long sandy benches and navigates through vegetation at water's edge. An optional diversion to a good slot canyon is detailed below.

The trail heads northeast, away from the parking area and runs through a transition zone above the creek. At one third-of-a-mile, it drops toward the stream for the first crossing. As with many of the crossings, determining the best rocks to use while hopping across the stream may require a little study. A less obvious path heads up the flat ledge on the other side to join an old road. Ahead, a dense stand of big sage appears right before the trail rounds a point around the southern wall.

The second stream crossing leads to a long sandy bench that can be a spectacular flower garden during a wet spring. After this pleasant stroll, the crossings occur more frequently, and some routes are easier and more obvious than others. While there are a couple of spots where low water levels or recent deposition may change the number of crossings, usually there will be 16 required to get to the east park boundary.

At the sixth crossing, a huge Navajo dome patterned with heavily eroded fractures looms on the right side of the canyon. The canyon becomes less wide at the next ford, and after two more crossings, Pleasant Creek runs through an interesting sluice in the bedrock.

Around the 2.4 mile mark the sheer wall on the south side ends, and a large sand flat extends further south. A nice optional diversion is possible if you re-cross the creek to the right and follow a visible hiker-made path to a wash leading from an opening in the Navajo Sandstone. This part of the canyon has a couple of good slot sections for hikers to explore before turning around at a large chockstone near the end of the slot. Several obstacles are present and pools of water can be found during wet times.

Back on the main trail; two more crossings proceed a climb up a sandy slope to a gap in the neck of a tight meander. The trail quickly descends back to the creek from there. The canyon walls begin to lower after this point, and the stream follows a more direct path. The trail comes to an end at a fence that crosses the creek near the east boundary of the park. From this point, retrace your steps 3.8 miles back to the parking area.

9.9,Point to Point,4851,4383,1295,1098,5,23,Sovereign Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        Sovereign is the main artery trail of the Sovereign Trail System.  It runs from Willow Springs Road to the southern edge of Cedar Mountain.

The slickrock and singletrack trail begins at a junction with Pipeline coming from Willow Springs Road. You'll hike over numerous fields of slick rock interspersed with sections singletrack. There's climbing, descending and level trail along the way. 

From the start of Sovereign to the first intersection with Salt Wash the trail climbs gradually. From there through the third intersection, the route goes up and down and across multiple expanses of rock and dry, dusty washes. At the fourth intersection to the Salt Wash trail (L4 Sovereign Connect) you'll be faced with a steady climb. After passing L5 Sovereign Connect, the trail meets at the terminus of Salt Wash.  Stay left here to descend down towards Dalton Wells Road. 

At the bottom, continue on the Sovereign trail straight into the wash and will now head towards and skirt the southern base of Cedar Mountain. The trail climbs and levels out as it intersects with Long Valley Road.  Afterwards Sovereign descends slightly just before a stiff ascent up to the rim of Cedar Mountain.  

Once the real climbing starts you'll be greeted by slightly more technical and narrow singletrack. At the junction with Cedar Mountain stay left.  The trail continues to climb to the rim going west where it skirts the edge.  The section of Sovereign is a bit more loose and chossy than what you'll experience on the lower reaches of the trail.

Sovereign ends at an intersection with Brush Basin trail, a descent to the outer Sovereign trailhead on Dalton Wells Road near Hwy 191.

Alternatively, you can bear right at the intersection to stay on the Sovereign - Cedar Mountain Loop.

On the approach, the trail enters and exits a wash a number of times before reaching the mouth of the canyon.

For the remainder of the hike, the route will stay on the bottom of the canyon, sometimes on rock, but mostly on sand. A little ways ahead, the canyon begins a series of curves and becomes very deep. The walls rise hundreds of feet above and are decorated with dramatic desert varnish. A recent rockfall has dropped a pretty banded sandstone into the wash just after the bends in the canyon start. A small pour-off and rock jam are easily passed.

The canyon remains impressive and easy to navigate up to an undercut and chockstone. This obstacle can be bypassed by retreating 100 feet down canyon and finding a user-made bypass on the south side. This steep, loose climb drops easily back in the canyon which soon ends in a rubble slope.

Since the canyon beyond the bypass is not quite as interesting as that below, the undercut in the main wash is probably a good point to turn around for most. The return trip changes the light and offers different aspects along the way, and, like most Capitol Reef canyons, the way out is just as good as the way in.

3.0,Point to Point,11132,9649,678,1500,14,36,Burro Pass Trail #315,Difficult,4.0,"        If you take a commercial shuttle, you'll start this hike from Geyser Pass, as mapped. If you are shuttling yourself, you can start lower: at Oowah Lake, at the Geyser Pass parking area, at the pass, or further up the Burro Pass road, depending on your vehicle and energy level.

The route from Geyser Pass (named for an early settler, not an actual water spout) works upward to Burro Pass at about 11,150-ft. Along the way you'll hike jeep trails and singletrack, this is a steep trail though!

From the pass, the trail drops precipitously down through evergreen forest, sharp switchbacks, black dirt, igneous rocks and roots. This is a difficult, and rugged trail, in a way that is out of character with most of Moab. Eventually, you reach jeep road again and continue left, then up and down in aspen glades. If you are lucky, you'll be here in the fall when the trees are gold and luminous.

It travels through aspen stands with outstanding views back towards Moab and Canyonlands National Park. The trail is not super technical and can be hikeed in either direction, but this is certainly the recommended direction.

It begins with a descent into Brumley Creek. The last 1/4 mile into the creek is very steep and then you'll have a steep 1/4-mile climb back out of the drainage. The trail will then mellow out as you climb towards the highpoint. Once you hit the switchbacks, the trail becomes steep again before gaining a high point on the trail. You'll traverse with a quick 1/4-mile descent before going back to the same contour. After the second highpoint, you'll begin a steep downhill to the La Sal Pass Rd. When the trail becomes really steep look for Squaw Springs. This is a nice stop used by some of the early settlers to the area.

Slickrock to sand, forest to grassy fields and possibly even a water crossing or two during a heavy rain. Seldom flat and never in a straight line, the trail winds its way around a large basin west of UT 313. The route drops down several rock shelves and across a couple different drainages before a meandering climb back up the other side - regardless of which direction you choose to hike it.

It’s hard not to stop and admire the amazing rock-work that went into the construction of this trail by the builders as you hike certain sections. The same can be said about the natural scenery in this area, the trail itself is technical enough to demand a continuous level of attention on your footing.

Because of the constantly changing trail and overall length, this trail by itself will be a challenge for some. But by beginning and ending on the Chisholm Trail, this loop can be easily integrated with other trails in the area for a much longer hike for anyone wanting to do so.

The trail then turns back to the southeast and then starts to cross a series of drainages and avalanche paths in the northern shadow of Logan Peak. The avalanche paths are of particular interest with the steep cliffs and gullies above and the talus underfoot. In the middle of one of the avalanche paths there is a roughly made sign that shows a small path off to a spring to the left (north) which is a short jaunt off of the path for some water if you've run out. 

After this sign, the trail goes up some switchbacks as it ascends up and around a small ridge. The trail continues to undulate but gradually ascends as it crosses these drainages and heads toward the Inspiration Point Road FR 126. 

Eventually the trail enters a dense forest, and as it passes through this forest it crosses a final, more shallowly sloping drainage that has a faint trail going off to the right. The actual Logan Dry-Mill Hollow trail continues to the left and ends up meeting up with the Inspiration Point Road FR 126, where the trail ends.

Expect two-way traffic along this route. This description assumes a start at the north end where it begins on the Big Lonely trail 50 yards west of UT313. 

The first mile is a twisty route across an open meadow, a dirt road and cattle guard before gradually starting up into the pinion pines. Once in the trees, the trail constantly transitions between rock and hard pack, working its way out along the edges of the canyons whenever possible. Even heading uphill the trail maintains a nice grade and never seems to climb for too long or be overly steep.

At roughly five miles, the trail nears the Horsethief Campground, and then crosses the dirt access road. A small parking area and map/info kiosk is here. Shortly after is another route into the campground and the Rowdy trail. From the Campground, the Chisholm Trail can be accessed via two short trails; one directly across from the main entrance and the second at campsite #50 which is also conveniently close to a restroom. 

Continuing on the Chisholm Trail is made up of the same terrain but on more of an even elevation for the next 1.5 miles to where it crosses UT313. Here is another parking area with a map/info kiosk.

This trail doesn't have a lot of elevation change.

That said, the slope is very gradual save for a section of the wall itself which can be loose.

It connects to the Sidewinder Trail and can provide an alternative route for the lower section of Barrel Roll. Although it sits just below Barrel Roll, Precipice offers different terrain, plants, and views. 

Precipice is so named because of the tight squeeze that occurs in the middle section of the trail. Huge rocks slabs tumble down the slope from the upper rim and pinch the trail against a lower cliff edge. While trail construction has moderated the technical aspects of the trail, exposure is still a factor.

After about a half mile, the road ends at the Cache Valley Archery range (which is only open to members of the archery association, not just anyone who wants to go). 

Instead of going to the range, go to the left where the road crosses a small drainage where there is a sign that points to the left saying ""Card Canyon East 064"" and to the right saying ""Card Canyon West."" Take the fork to the right and the trail starts to slowly ascend by a dry creek bed. It continues through a varying forest with conifers, scrub oak, and some aspens at times. This can be a really gorgeous part in the fall as the colors are changing. 

Eventually, the trail starts to ascend more steeply through some rocky portions, and then it starts to switchback up onto the hillside above the drainage, which allows for some views of the cliff bands on the western side of the canyon, which are impressive.

From the Moab Canyon Paved Path, access to Deadman's Ridge starts on a doubletrack across from Rusty Spur.  Hike west, climbing a bit and winding around to the start of the trail which will be to your right.

The initial climb to get on the lower ridge is not steep and rolls along singletrack and slickrock.  The route ramps up a bit from here, climbing steadily to a high point on the trail.  It's worth taking a break here to enjoy the 360 degree views, including an incredible look into Arches National Park.

This trail passes through private land. The trail itself is open to the public, but any area off trail is private property and ought to be respected to ensure access to future users. 

The trail begins with some switchbacks, climbing to the top of ledge. The trail then follows the ledge for a ways and then climbs again. After several more switchbacks and some movement into and out of a few small gulches, you climb once more to reach the summit of Rocky Top. 

The top has several large boulders and provides great views of Kamas Valley, the back of the Wasatch Range, the west side of the Uintas, and much more. The climb is gradual enough that the running is great. This trail is mixed use, so you'll likely see bikes, horses, hikers, and runners. Weekends there is more traffic.

2.4,Point to Point,7609,5746,1863,0,15,38,Card Canyon East,Intermediate,4.0,"        From the sign that indicates the two forks of Card Canyon, take the left fork. It starts off by gradually ascending past a small picnic area, and then enters a sparsely populated forest. 
The trail has some fun, short rocky sections as it ascends as it follows the canyon bottom. Eventually it reaches a short switchback where the trail leaves the bottom of the canyon and starts to parallel it from up above, and has some short, fun downhill sections mixed in with the ascent. 

After a little over a half a mile from the starting point, there is a really spectacular rock thumb jutting up, right by the trail, off to the left (as you are going up). This is definitely one of the highlights of this trail. Soon after passing the rock thumb, the trail switches back and ascends into the meadow that houses the ponds that are surrounded by bluebells in spring. Keep an eye on the trail as you go past the ponds, and then the trail becomes distinct again as it starts to ascend steeply, over fallen trees and through an aspen grove until it emerges into a clearing, and then onto the Adams Corral Road.

5.8,Point to Point,6087,5725,602,704,4,15,Jazz-Chrome Molly,Intermediate,4.0,"        This is the original Red Fleet trail. Start from the dirt parking area 0.6 miles from US 191. 

The trail immediately starts on a singletrack downhill. Cross the wash on the culvert, head along the fence and up the bottom. At the junction, follow signs to the left to begin the first climb. 

Once at the top, you'll swing right into another short, downhill section. At the bottom of the hill, head left to continue up a small valley. 

After a couple of wash crossings, you'll see another sign directing you left to the second climb. At the top of this hill, continue left through a juniper section which takes you to the BLM-Simplot boundary. The trail continues along the fence line in a roller coaster segment of short ups and downs. 

As you leave the boundary line, you enter the ""Jazz Gets Down"" downhill.

At the bottom of the hill, make a sharp right turn to continue on JCM back to the parking area. You'll climb out of the wash to a doubletrack, where the trail crosses and continues to a water trough. From there, head left for a long, low angle descent. 

At the next water trough, bear right to a short downhill where you head back into the valley and eventually start back on the trail the way you came. After following the fence line and Hwy. 191,  you'll cross a wash culvert/cattle guard and start heading up hill. At the bermed turn heading left, watch for the blast warning sign and a faint trail heading down to the paved road. 

Please climb back to the TH on this road to avoid downhill traffic coming down the trail.

0.0,Unknown,6031,5991,0,39,18,18,Sipapu Overlook Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        The Sipapu Overlook Trail is a great way to view the largest bridge in the National Monument without too much of a workout. Sipapu is also the second largest natural bridge in the US. From the parking area, take the Sipapu Trail which descends some slickrock slabs with steps cut out to ease the walk.  Traverse west along the wide rock bench, keeping back from the edge.  This is a neat spot to peer across the canyon rim.  After a series of steel stairs, you must climb down a short log ladder to get over a cliff band.  

Continue along the cliff under a shady stretch of trail that is overhung by sheer rock.  Up ahead you can see people traveling along a nearly level and very picturesque walkway of rock.  These unique features of the trail make it memorable even for frequent desert visitors.  The Sipapu Trail to the canyon bottom branches off to the right, but keep going straight for the Overlook Trail. Arrive at an exposed spit of rock that juts out into the canyon, look down and to your left to see Sipapu Bridge itself. Retrace your steps back to the parking lot once you've finished marveling at Mother Nature's handiwork.

As the park's brochures and info boards explain, natural bridges are created differently than arches.  Bridges are formed by and span streams of flowing water.  Arches are formed by weather-powered erosion or pounding waves.

The trail starts with sweeping turns that criss-cross back and forth across the gully. As it descends the radius of the turns begin to straighten and the slope begins to mellow slightly.

The trail itself is a short, mellow hike. Starting at its junction with the Big Mesa Trail, the trail quickly climbs up into the pinions mixed with slickrock patches. A huge expanse of slickrock on the north-facing slope is a fun distraction from the climb, just be mindful of the edge.

Starting from the top end of Boondocks, you'll be at the edge of the mesa top looking down over a red dirt valley littered with clusters of white sandstone formations. Follow the purple paint stripes to the right (Dunestone is bright green). 

The trail descends quickly through a break in the rim, across a saddle and around to another intersection. Stay right to take the eastern leg of the Boondocks loop - a more open and rolling feel. Going left will take you through more twists and turns among boulders.  Both legs end up at the bottom of a wash at an intersection with Dunestone.

The trails in this system reflect the rugged and challenging terrain they are built within. Tight corners, constant grade changes are present. Surfaces vary from hard pack to slickrock to a bit of sand as the trails wind their way through pinion pines and rock canyons, all the while delivering unparalleled views of the majestic Moab area.

This trail intersects Wildcat at about its halfway point near the top of the ridge. Users will find that this hike-around offers gentle terrain and more pleasant surface than the original section of 7-Up.

The first few hundred feet are a class 2 scramble with loose rock and some exposure, then it levels out and remains steep but safer the rest of the way. The trail isn't as well defined as the Dry Canyon Trail and disappears slightly in a few spots, but it was easy to follow and you stay along the ridge the entire time.

It runs downhill south to the reservoir. After a little over a mile you cross a road and connect with the main loop around the water. The loop is great. Pretty flat. You end up at a neat park with a lot of crossfit equipment and a beach volleyball court. There are also some fake bouldering rocks. The trail crosses over the dam and then connects back together.

1.5,Point to Point,7108,5170,1938,0,24,57,Mt. Wire South,Difficult,4.0,"        Mount Wire is a cool summit over SLC, worth it for the views and for the workout, and maybe for the paraglide launch if that's your thing. There's also a small lookout tower on top, and you can climb into it (at your own risk) for an even better view.

Most people reach the top of Mount Wire summit via George's Hollow Trail which goes past The Living Room. And while that may be the nicer trail, it stays icy/muddy for a lot longer than this south-facing trail. The caveat of the south trail is that it's very steep, going more or less straight up a ridge line. It's unmaintained, rugged, and loose underfoot in some places, making it a bit hazardous in the downhill direction.

So you might take this alternative route if you want a dry hike in the spring or if you want a better burn for hill training. To make a loop with this and the standard trail, I recommend going up this south trail and down George's Hollow, but you can pick your poison.

Take care to note the ridge switch up above Rudy's Flat for the return trip (if coming back the way you came.) Otherwise, you may end up going down the wrong ridge.

If returning down the center of City Creek Canyon, be wary of moose, mountain lions, and hunters. You can take a north fork of City Creek Canyon to regain the ridge at Rudy's Flat. The trail starts just up the canyon a few yards from campsite 23. The trail is well worn and easy to follow.

5.7,Point to Point,6907,5509,1567,430,7,15,Little Cottonwood Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.7,"        Starting from the Right Hand Fork trailhead parking lot, you can hike back down the road a few hundred feet until you get to the corral. Stay to the right of the corral and go through the gate to start up the trail. The trail starts out at a pretty steady climbing grade as it climbs up and crosses a dry creek bed and ascends out of the trees into a vast meadow with rolling hills. At this point, the trail turns into a doubletrack, passes a few water troughs for livestock, and continues climbing the road. If you get here at the right time of morning the sun shines beautifully on the dew that settles on the grasses here, which creates a gorgeous picture. 

As you continue you'll reach a high point and start descending to another watering hole (which is quite disgusting later on in the year after the cows have all gotten to it). Pass it and start to ascend. As you do, you'll come to a gate and then continue up and around a hill. As you continue you should be able to see into a vast basin with forested hills in the background and grassy fields below. From here, you can see Mount Beirdneau and to the south of that is the mouth of Logan Canyon. 

As you continue along the trail, you'll hit the main high point of the trail as you ascend through a small grove of aspens. After this, the trail switches back a couple of times as you descend back into the meadows and around to the head of the Willow Creek drainage, where the trail meets up with the Temple Fork Road.

2.4,Point to Point,6225,5961,169,345,4,11,Eagle Crest Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.8,"        To get to this trail, park at the Maple Hollow Trailhead and head southeast on the South Maple Hollow Trail through the underpass under Highland Boulevard. The trails then split, with the South Maple Hollow Trail continuing to the right and the Eagle Crest Trail starting to the left (it is well signed). 

The trail starts out pretty flat and even drops slightly in elevation as the trail goes into a drainage and crosses a small stream. After this, the trail starts to ascend slowly out of the drainage and towards a ridge, going in and out of small maple and scrub oak forests. At about 3/4 mile in, the trail gets out onto an open hillside, which allows for some good views of Utah Lake and into the cities of Utah Valley, as well as some good views of Box Elder Peak and Mount Timpanogos. 

After about one mile, the trail reaches the Eagle Crest Trailhead, which is also the apex of the route. After passing by this trailhead the rest of the trail is basically downhill at a pretty manageable grade, which makes it a fun and fast descent. The last mile and a half are mostly on an open hillside, which continues to allow for great views of the surrounding areas. 

This makes it a great trail for hikes at sunrise or sunset, although it can get pretty hot on summer afternoons (south facing, not much shade). The very end of the trail finishes up with a couple of small switchbacks, and then the trail ends at Suncrest Drive.

From here, you'll begin the hike by heading up all the wooden stairs, uphill in the neighborhood, passing about 4 homes. Keep your eyes open for a catwalk between two homes. Follow the steep trail to the waterfall.  This is a good hike for family and kids.  Rock climbing opportunities are located to the left and above the falls.  The falls themselves are more spectacular during spring/early summer runoff, and I would give the trail 4 stars during that time.

1.3,Point to Point,5718,5054,664,0,10,17,Mill Hollow Trail,Intermediate,3.8,"        This is now the official route of the Mill Hollow Trail - from the Logan River Trail to the point in Mill Hollow where the trail splits over to the Bridger Look-Off Trail to the right, and then from this point the Mill Hollow Trail has been redirected to end up in Spring Hollow. Higher in Mill Hollow (where the trail used to officially go, and still does but isn't maintained), the brush gets too thick and the avalanches destroy the trail, or something like that. Either way, the Mill Hollow Trail has been redirected to end up in Spring Hollow.

So, the trail begins by breaking off of the Logan River Trail, not too far from the Spring Hollow parking area. The trail immediately begins to ascend some nice switchbacks through small, intermittent forests and sagebrush patches on the hillside. Eventually, the trail meets up with the Bridger Look-Off Trail at a fork in the trail and then continues on to the left as it gradually ascends into Spring Hollow. Along the way, the trail passes from the sagebrush meadow into a lush forest with cliffs on the right-hand side of the trail, and some great views of Logan Canyon and parts of Spring Hollow (including the Crimson Trail) along the way. Eventually, the trail ends at a junction with the Spring Hollow Trail at a set of rocky switchbacks.

5.3,Point to Point,5928,5665,405,259,2,21,White Canyon Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.8,"        This trail connects all three bridges in Natural Bridges National Monument along the bottom of the canyon. It is unmaintained so at times it can be rough going - either bushwhacking or very sandy. Plan extra time to account for this than the distance along would suggest. 

Starting from the Sipapu Bridge parking area take the Sipapu Trail path down to the bottom of the canyon. Begin heading southwest through the bottom of the canyon. The trail itself can be hard to follow as it disappears in brush or blends in with the dry river bottom, but you won't get lost because you're in a canyon. Do try to avoid cryptobiotic soil. It can take decades for the desert to recover from even a single footprint. 

Continue heading along the bottom of the canyon to the Kachina Bridge. The trail will pass through the bridge. You need to take the Kachina Bridge Trail part way up onto a ledge to bypass a dry falls that is just south of Kachina Bridge. 

The trail will then rejoin the dry river bottom after the dry falls and head south. The canyon is more winding after this point so the distance is longer than it may appear. Eventually, you'll get to Owachomo Bridge, the third and southernmost bridge in Natural Bridges National Monument. The trail will end here. 

You'll either need to arrange a shuttle, retrace your steps, or take the Owachomo Bridge to Sipapu Bridge Trail on the return journey.

There is a little climb at the beginning and a lot of rocks. if you have already done some miles, be careful here, very careful.  

If you are just getting started, you still need to pay attention to the rocky section through the first mile.  The trail flattens out some after you get around the first point and is sandy singletrack with some rocks clumped together here and there.  In the second mile, it is mostly flat with a small climb at the end and then there is a short downhill section with some rocks to navigate.  Where the trail gets back to sand is a good place to see some buffalo as you head back towards White Rocks Loop Road. This trail is a lot of fun and has views of the lake and Nevada to the west.

0.6,Point to Point,6204,5768,0,436,13,38,Sipapu Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.8,"Sipapu Bridge is the second largest natural bridge in the US. From the parking area, the trail descends some slickrock slabs with steps cut out to ease the journey. Traverse west along the wide rock bench, keeping back from the edge. This is a neat spot to peer across the canyon rim. After a series of steel stairs, you must climb down a short log ladder to get over a cliff band. 

Continue along the cliff under a shady stretch of trail that is overhung by sheer rock. Up ahead you can see people traveling along a nearly level and very picturesque walkway of rock. These unique features of the trail make it memorable even for frequent desert visitors. The main Sipapu Trail to the canyon bottom branches off to the right, but if you want a quick detour, you can go straight for the Sipapu Overlook Trail. 

Back on the main Sipapu Trail, switchback steeply down through desert vegetation pausing to look around at the canyon walls looming all around. Back on slickrock, use the handrails to scoot down two friction spots, gripping with the soles of your shoes. Two more wooden ladders and steps carved into the rock aid the descent through steep areas. Finally, you arrive on the canyon floor where the sandy wash and seasonal White Canyon Creek lay. Explore around this area, making your way under the arch and reveling in the brilliant reds and oranges of the striped rock walls.  Retrace your steps back to the parking lot once you've finished marveling at Mother Nature's handiwork.  Pause to take breaks on the arduous ascent, and, as always, bring adequate water and sun protection.  

As the park's brochures and info boards explain, natural bridges are created differently than arches. Bridges are formed by and span streams of flowing water. Arches are formed by weather-powered erosion or pounding waves.

It starts off with an incline from the trailhead up to a pretty level section through a small grove of trees but then drops into some ups and downs along the deer fence. This section offers great views of Cache Valley and the Wellsvilles, as well as plenty of wildflowers if done in June or July. 

As you near the mouth of Providence Canyon there is another steep incline followed by a good section of downhill as you drop down into the mouth of the canyon where you get good views of Spring Creek and the cliffs in Providence Canyon. The entire route is along a well packed dirt road (doubletrack) which can get overgrown in the early spring (so wear some gaiters) but this is great by the fall.

    ",UT
2.8,Point to Point,7144,6018,1126,0,8,21,North Canyon Trail,Intermediate,3.6,"        To get there you take Bountiful Boulevard and turn onto Canyon Creek Drive, heading east (uphill). The road is paved up to a gate, which is usually open in the summer time. The dirt road beyond the gate isn't too bad, but it might not be the best road to take in a small car. I would rather just hike it. If you drive past the gate, there is a small parking lot at the end of the dirt road where you can park your vehicle and the actual North Canyon Trail begins.

The trail begins in a nice meadow, with beautiful wildflowers in the spring. The trail climbs a little bit and crosses over a few creek beds (can be marshy in the spring and early summer). Then there are a series of switchbacks that lead you above the canyon so that you can then follow the north side of the ridge between City Creek Canyon and North Canyon. Most of this portion of the trail is shaded by large pine trees.

Soon, the trail comes out onto the top of the ridge and follows the ridgeline to Rudy's Flat, a beautiful meadow at about 7,150 feet. Rudy's Flat serves as a junction for three trails: the North Canyon Trail, the Mueller Park Trail, and the North Fork Trail out of City Creek Canyon. There is also a trail that heads east and climbs up to the high mountain ridge above Rudy's Flat.

The area is incredibly green and lush in the spring and early summer, and the fall colors are fantastic. This is also a great snowshoe route in the winter time.

8.2,Point to Point,8968,4757,4247,37,10,37,Birch Canyon Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        The first couple of miles of this trail are up a dirt road, and although it is not as beautiful as the rest of the trail, it offers a good warm up with some rolling hills and (if you go early enough in the season, like in April) views of the creek and some beautiful forest canopies and meadows. Make sure that you stick to the main road, as there are many side roads that can be misleading. You'll go through two gates before you reach the final (third) gate, which is the Forest Service gate. This gate has a permanent lock on it and a large parking area in front of it (you could drive up and park here, to avoid hiking up the road with a higher clearance vehicle).

From the Forest Service gate, you have two options - you can either take the doubletrack trail all the way up, or you can take the singletrack (the option I will describe) that splits off from and eventually crosses the doubletrack several times.

As you start up the trail, you'll get some glimpses of Birch Creek and start to see wildflowers, especially if you go early in the season (May or June). Less than a quarter of a mile up the doubletrack, you'll see a singletrack trail going off to the left - take this trail and you'll avoid the first large crossing of Birch Creek. You'll cut through a meadow that is sparsely populated with trees and eventually drop down to a very small creek crossing. 

Continuing along the trail, you'll pass through meadows and forested areas with rolling hills and occasional dry stream crossings. This creek is used for Hyde Park's water, so depending on the season or amount of rainfall/snowmelt the crossings could be dry or not.

A mile and a half from the Forest Service Gate, if you look back and to the southwest, there is a beautiful rocky ridge with towering cliffs that just ascends to the top of the southern wall of the canyon.

Two and a half miles from the Forest Service Gate, there is a major stream crossing (covered with rotting logs) that transitions the doubletrack section of the trail to a fully singletrack trail that winds up, loosely following the creek up the canyon past beautiful cliffs from the north side of Flat Top Mountain. Eventually, as you reach the ""elbow"" where the canyon turns south, you'll get views of spectacular cliffs to the East. The trail then ascends past the spring that feeds Birch Creek and starts to switchback up through meadows until you reach the ridge between Birch and Dry canyons.

4.7,Point to Point,5782,5094,757,525,5,25,BST: North Ogden,Intermediate,3.7,"        Mostly singletrack from North Ogden Divide heading past the base of Ben Lomond Peak and towards Willard. It's pretty flat for a mile or so then switchbacks to the remaining flat section.

The trail is mostly hard pack dirt with occasional stones, roots, and easy rocky sections. Beyond the switchbacks, comes a smooth, winding section that makes up the best the trail has to offer.  

Unfortunately, the entire trail follows massive power lines and, in spots, the trail is actually on the power company's access road. This could be ignored but the power company's use of powerful herbicides killing the flora below the power lines takes away from the experience. However, the views of Ogden to the southwest and Ben Lomond Peak to the north are exceptional!  

Here's to hoping this trail weaves its way to Willard and beyond!

5.4,Point to Point,6353,6085,442,265,2,13,Riverview Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.7,"        This trail runs along the western foothills of the Coyote Canyon Ridge, starting from the River Trailhead (just off State Route 32). The trail immediately ascends a few switchbacks to meet up with the Sheep Bones Trail and the Coyote Canyon Trail. From this trail junction, the River Trail continues to the right, and right down from this junction you get some amazing views of the Wasatch Back and the Provo River valley near Midway. 

The trail contours in and out of several drainages, with a few minor climbs and descents, but is generally a pretty flat trail through the scrub oak and sage brush. During the fall, this trail can be gorgeous as it allows for views of all of the foothills of the Wasatch Back, which can be covered in crimson leaves if your timing is right. 

A little over three miles in, the trail passes another trail junction—this time with Chop'd Coyote that goes up and over the Coyote Canyon Ridge. Continue straight to keep on the River Trail, and after a couple more miles the trail ends at a junction with the Coyote Canyon Trail.

5.0,Point to Point,9634,7065,2576,18,10,32,Yellow Pine Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        There's ample parking and vault toilets at the trailhead.

Starting at the Yellow Pine trailhead, cross the bridge and continue east for a bit until the trail turns northeast and heads through a Forest Service gate (be sure to secure it closed behind you). The trail is wide and continues steadily uphill while crossing Yellow Pine creek on several good footbridges at 1.5, 1.8, and 2.5 miles. Shortly after that third footbridge there is a very rough rocky section of trail that is worth mentioning. Don't worry as it only continues like this for about 100 yards. At about mile three the trail starts to climb above the thick trees and you start getting some terrific views of the Wasatch Range. However, the rocky way begins again here and many times the trail IS part of the rivers tributaries. I crossed water 14 times and was happy I had my waterproof boots on. This is also a steep and long climb.

Continue until you reach the upper regions of the drainage and a subtle sign, in the form of a log with engraved with a chainsaw, at about 3.7 miles. Take the left trail headed west to continue to Yellow Pine Lakes. This trail dissipates after about 100 yards into a marshy section of the run off. I walked over a mile before I got to the lake.  A right onto Castle Lake Trail takes you to, you guessed it, Castle Lake.

3.1,Point to Point,9981,8638,1345,588,12,32,Twin Lakes Pass Trail #027,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        This ""trail"" starts out as a paved road, just behind the Shallow Shaft restaurant, but quickly turns into a rocky, rutted dirt road. It makes a couple of switchbacks, but then starts heading generally northeast, in the direction of Twin Lakes Pass. 

The road is pretty wide and easily followed, with a steady amount of elevation gain along the entire profile. About 0.75 miles in, there is a locked gate meant to keep vehicles from traveling along the road, but it's open for pedestrians to travel around. 

Some of the points of interest start about 1 mile in when the road crosses through a portion of old mine tailings. Shortly thereafter, the trail takes a right turn to the southeast, right at the base of a large series of mine tailings piles. After going to the southeast, the trail goes through a nice meadow, then starts to ascend a little steep, rocky section where you pass by an abandoned mine tunnel that's right by the trail, and then you get out into some beautiful meadows below Twin Lakes Pass. 

About 1.5 miles in, a fork in the road takes one trail to the north toward Silver Fork while the Twin Lakes Pass Trail branches off, turns into singletrack, and heads east, toward Twin Lakes Pass. This portion of the trail after the junction ascends through some beautiful alpine meadows, small stands of sparse pine trees, and eventually arrives at Twin Lakes Pass. From the pass, there are great views of the Wasatch Crest, Twin Lakes Reservoir below, and parts of Brighton ski area. This is an exceptional place to see the sunrise, or even come in the twilight hours.

After cresting the pass, the trail heads to the left, contouring around the hillside below the Honeycomb Cliffs (be careful here—there is an unmaintained spur trail that heads down towards Twin Lakes Reservoir that looks like the main trail, but actually is not. It descends quickly, then becomes pretty steep and eventually becomes overgrown). This section is pretty fun, as the views are great, the singletrack is generally pretty good (although it is technical in places), and culminates in a steep, rocky, but really short descent by a small rock formation and emerges onto a wide ski run. This ski run is an easy hike, and you stay on it for about a quarter of a mile, and it turns to the right and starts descending towards Twin Lakes dam. The ski run soon turns into some nice singletrack, then ends too quickly at the top of the dam. The trail ends at a junction with the Twin Lakes Trail.

3.2,Point to Point,8176,6025,2151,1,13,51,Cutler Basin Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        From the trailhead, the trail follows an old service road for the first half mile or so at a pretty reasonable grade. From the end of this road, the trail steepens significantly and in parts is unfortunately partially saturated by the springs that empty themselves on this side of Ben Lomond, which makes the ascent difficult in places for the first two miles. However, the steep portions are rewarded later by flat meadows and easy grades on the last mile of the trail, where it seems to be slightly better developed. 

After the first two miles, there is a fork in the trail where if you continue straight it goes to Cutler Spring. If you take the fork to the left, you'll continue along the Cutler Basin Trail. At this fork, you are afforded amazing views of Willard Peak as well as the giant avalanche chute that sits below it which are worth the trek to this point by themselves. After continuing along the Cutler Basin Trail (the left fork), the trail leaves the exposed hillside and enters a forest as it goes up to connect with the Ben Lomond trail.

1.5,Point to Point,5741,5133,635,27,9,20,Ghost Falls Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.7,"        This trail starts from a split with the Aqueduct Trail, and quickly switches back and starts heading east, toward Ghost Falls. The trail starts out relatively flat, but after about 0.4 miles, the trail starts to steepen up, until it hits a small crest about 0.2 miles later. After hitting this crest, the trail descends as it heads toward Ghost Falls, and then the trail passes right by the falls over a small bridge, about 0.75 miles from the start of the trail. The waterfall can be somewhat hard to see at times, since during the summer the vegetation grows in pretty thick and during the fall sometimes the flow isn't very large, but when you time it right, it is a pretty little waterfall. 

After passing the waterfall, the trail starts to head up towards the Jacob's Ladder Trail via a series of long switchbacks, which aren't too bad for ascending, and are really fun for descending. After 1.25 miles, the trail goes right by a spur to the Jacob's Ladder Trail, and continues on, paralleling the road, until it meets up with the road right by the beginning of the Jacob's Ladder Trail.

5.5,Point to Point,8307,5461,3113,974,14,59,GWT: Dry Canyon Trail #049,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        Starting at the Dry Canyon Trailhead, this trail starts immediately up Dry Canyon, which in the beginning is a cool place with towering, vertical canyon walls that look like they have some fun rock climbing routes on them. Pretty soon, the trail emerges from this short canyon section into a series of meadows, which are really beautiful in the spring, when they are green and things are blooming. 

There are also a series of spur trails from this meadow, which can be confusing. To stay on the GWT: Dry Canyon Trail follow the dry creek bed, but stay on the trail that's just a bit up out of it. A little more than a mile in on the trail, you'll enter into a slightly more developed forest that offers some of the first real shade along the trail. 

A little over 2 miles in, the trail starts to get a bit steeper, and emerges from the forest on a loose, rocky trail that splits from the main Dry Canyon drainage and heads up the middle of a series of erosion control terraces until it finally reaches the high point of the trail—the saddle below Big Baldy. There are some good views from this saddle of Cascade Mountain and southern Utah Valley, as well as some good views to the north, and of Mount Timpanogos. 

From the Big Baldy Saddle, the trail descends for the first time, via a series of nice, gradual switchbacks through some aspens and pines, and then after the switchbacks continues to descend as it heads toward the start of the Battle Creek Trail. There are a few fun, rocky sections through here as well as beautiful stands of aspen trees and meadows. 

After meeting up with the Battle Creek Trail, the trail stops descending and starts to ascend slowly through the same meadows towards Grove Creek Canyon, but before it reaches the Grove Creek Trail, this segment transitions into the GWT: Timpooneke-Chris Flat Trail.

You can also access many other trails in the area from the Desolation Trail, allowing for a variety of hikes. Sections of the trail are open to mountain biking and horseback riding so be courteous to other trails users. Other sections of the trail enter the Mount Olympus Wilderness where you'll enjoy a more remote feel.

0.6,Point to Point,5995,5656,61,338,14,49,Kachina Bridge Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        Although the trail to Kachina Bridge is slightly longer than the one to Sipapu Bridge, it is less steep and feels less taxing. Kachina Bridge presides over the confluence of White Canyon and Armstrong Canyon. It is considered the geologically ""youngest"" of the three bridges in the National Monument because less erosion has chipped away at the span leaving it thicker than the others. The bridge is named for the Kachina dancers that play a central role in Hopi religious tradition. 

From the parking area, briefly follow the paved Kachina Bridge Overlook Trail before taking a left onto the natural Kachina Bridge Trail. Descend some slickrock sections with the aid of handrails and the friction of your shoes. Then follow steps cut into the rock and a series of many, many stone steps engineered into stairway-like precision. After more switchbacks, you arrive at a junction with the Kachina to Owachomo Trail. This is the long, inner-canyon ""loop"" trail that visits all three bridges in the monument. Staying right to continue along the Kachina Bridge Trail, traverse another bench near a pour-over and drop into the wash at the bottom of the canyon using a log ladder.  

From here, follow the cairns along the stream to the surprisingly thick Kachina Bridge. The bridge spans White Canyon where it joins Armstrong Canyon. The steep canyon walls often provide welcome shade here in this peaceful grotto. A great deal of impressive rock art can be found under the right-hand side of the arch above a small ledge and also further under the bridge. Both pictographs (painted images) and petroglyphs (scratched images) are visible, showing dancing figures, animals, symbols and hand prints.  

Budget enough time to laze around in this sandy oasis, making up stories about what the petroglyphs mean, having a snack, or taking a nap. On your return trip, be sure to stay to the left as you pass back under the bridge, that way you retrace your steps back up Armstrong Canyon (instead of heading right down White Canyon and out of the park).  Take breaks on the steep ascent and, as always, bring adequate water and sun protection.

As the park's brochures and info boards explain, natural bridges are created differently than arches. Bridges are formed by and span streams of flowing water. Arches are formed by weather-powered erosion or pounding waves.

One popular way to do this trail involves taking the Sterling Express chairlift up, and hiking down.  Alternatively, if you hike up, you can ride the lift down for free.  

From the top of the Sterling Express lift, start heading west on the Homeward Bound ski run to contour around the backside of Bald Mountain.  Enjoy the views on this east side of Bald Mountain you can see the Jordanelle Reservoir and, in the distance, the Uinta Mountains.  Soon you'll branch off to the east on a singletrack path across open the fields of Mayflower Bowl towards the top of the Mayflower chairlift.  The Silver Lake trail begins in earnest here, first cutting across several ski runs, heading northwesterly on wide packed dirt trail surface.  Pop in and out of strips of aspen and fir between the runs and lift lines.  The trail steepens a bit and widens into a doubletrack access road closer to the Silver Lake Village base area.

2.9,Point to Point,6903,5851,1052,554,11,23,Old Wagon Trail,Difficult,3.7,"        The Old Wagon Trail offers nice views of the Waterpocket Fold, but there is a lack of diversity along the trail that some hikers may find unexciting. Parts of the loop are very rough and rocky, more so than any other front country trail. Despite this, the trail offers plenty of solitude for those who want to avoid the crowds.

Immediately from the parking area, the trail drops into and across a wash. On the other side a steady climb leads up through the Moenkopi Formation. A half-mile of steady climbing gains a slight break in the slope after two sets of steps. This is a good place to pause and turn around to take in the emerging view of the Henry Mountains over Capitol Gorge.

A short distance later, the loop portion of the the hike begins to the left. If the viewpoint is your goal, simply continue straight ahead up the slope, but if completing the loop, it is best to follow the arrow left.

The tread of the trail gets significantly rougher after the junction and the climbs continue in earnest. A half mile from the start of the loop, the trail nears the rim of Capitol Gorge. Nestled in the distant formations below is Capitol Reef’s oldest rock layer, the White Rim Sandstone. Back to the east, the view has improved and now sweeps farther to the north.

A third of a mile farther on, the path makes a gentle turn to the north and the climbing is done. The 1,100 foot elevation gain over the last 1.7 miles is certainly a good workout. After leaving the canyon rim, it is only a little ways further to a right turn onto a downhill section of the Old Wagon Trail.

The route follows the old road down, then turns left. Continue on, and soon a sign indicates the spur trail to the viewpoint (straight ahead) and the return to the trailhead to the right. The short climb up the rocks to the viewpoint is well worth the effort. 

From the spur trail junction, the main loop trail proceeds south, following the contours of the landscape for a short distance, and then trends more to the east as it works down the slope. Happily, the rocks are largely left behind, and the tread is smooth enough that travel is pleasant. All the way back down to the trailhead, the broad views to the east are wonderful.

1.4,Point to Point,6022,5758,264,0,3,9,Red Canyon,Easy/Intermediate,3.7,"        Red Canyon is the perfect place for geology enthusiasts and hikers alike. Its beautiful scenery, compacted into a short, 1.4-mile canyon, leaves all who enter its broad canyon walls both inspired and humbled by their natural surroundings. Not to mention, the canyon happens to have been cut perpendicular to the rock layers in this area, providing visitors with a first-hand experience with the vibrant sedimentary rocks that make Capitol Reef famous. 

Starting where the Red Canyon Trail ends at the wash, the thin red beds of the Carmel Formation rise steeply on the south side as the drainage cuts across them. Shortly, the tan sandstone of the Page is followed by the slightly whiter Navajo, as the wash turns north about a tenth of a mile from the start. To the right, a steep slope of Navajo is topped by the nearly indistinguishable Page and capped by the much more obvious yellow Carmel. After a pleasant and well vegetated stretch, the wash again cuts through the Navajo to the west. A series of finely grouped perpendicular cracks are displayed on a slope on the right side of the wash. Exfoliation of thin layers of sandstone is occurring here, exposing solid, uncracked rock. The wash meanders to the south, before bending to the west and entering the Kayenta Formation with its alternating light-colored sandstones and red shales. At about the 2-mile mark, the solid red Wingate Sandstone makes its appearance. Interesting rock layers at this location are evidence of its origin as dune sand.

Given the steep angle of the Wingate, it only takes another 3 or 4 minutes to hike right through its 350-foot thickness, emerging into the soft blue-gray and lavender Chinle Formation. The wash narrows and becomes wet, and reeds and tamarisk begin to appear. This is a good place to turn around, but the wash does continue. Before returning to the trailhead, note the Wingate to the west and how much higher it is than at the outcrop just to the north (right), indicating the true scale and form of the Waterpocket Fold. So is the power of erosion, since all the formations the route travels past were once in place here above the Chinle and have been removed, probably in only 10 to 20 million years. In hiking back from the Chinle and looking across the Notom-Bullfrog Road to the east, almost the entire span of dinosaur history is laid out in the space of just four miles.

The trail begins off of Big Cottonwood Canyon, and parking is limited. The first mile of the trail climbs steadily to a switchback. The second mile is more moderate grade, but is full of loose scree, and feels like climbing up a dry riverbed (or wet in the spring). The third mile is of more steep grade, greater than 20% in some places, and winds through the pines, aspen and alpine meadows, and the remains of the Wasatch mine can be seen.  

The last two miles rise above the 9,000 feet, above the tree-line in the valley, climbing in a series of very steep switchbacks to just over 10,000 feet.

The 2.5-mile-long Temple Quarry Trail is a family-friendly hike for anyone looking to connect with the heritage of St. George.

From 1871 to 1874 the Temple Quarry Trail was used by Mormon Pioneers to access the quarry on the southwest side of what’s known locally as the “black hill.” The quarry holds a vast deposit of lava rocks needed by the Mormon pioneers to construct the foundation and basement of the St. George Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-day Saints. The lava rocks are naturally resistant to the alkali that is found in the soil in St. George.

The beginning of the hike is slightly inclined; however, stairs have been added to assist in the ascent. After the initial incline, the well-marked trail is relatively level with benches and historical markers along the way. The trail wraps around the black hill, providing amazing views of Green Valley, Red Mountain, and Snow Canyon State Park. Near the turn around point, you'll find a loop where the wagons used to U-turn to haul the blocks back to town.

Both dogs and mountain bikes are allowed on the trail. This trail is fun for all ages, and the historical aspect allows for some fun teaching and observation moments.

From the parking area, follow the trail which is relatively flat and easy. The trail will cross a dry wash several times before it begins to ascend a bench on the right. The trail weaves along this bench gradually ascending. The rock formations include the ""Preacher,"" ""The Nuns"", ""Rectory"" and Castleton Tower.  Once the trail passes the foot of Castleton Tower, it will begin to descend slightly. 

When you reach a dirt 4x4 road, the Sylvester Trail ends and you return the way you came. It is possible to reach the La Sal Loop Road from here by crossing this dirt road and follow the trail to a second dirt road where you can turn right and follow out to the loop road.

Beginning at Three Forks, you cross a footbridge and follow Sixth Water Creek for a pleasant, shaded, 1.1 miles.  Across another footbridge, the trail forks. Follow Fifth Water Creek on the right (Sixth Water continues on the left).  

Numerous pools and small rapids liven the scenery along with strange looking conglomerate formations. You'll smell the odor from the hot sulfur springs, the largest of which are located 1.5 miles up Fifth Water Creek, where a cold waterfall meets the hot bubbling springs.  

Another mile up is the jeep road which crosses Rays Valley Road after another 1/2 mile. The remaining trail to Strawberry Ridge (4.5 miles) isn't used as often.  The jeep road continues about 1 mile and ends in the creek. You then cross Center Trail a mile beyond. Observe a number of old beaver dams.  

Although the trail may be a bit overgrown, stay with the bottom of the canyon until you meet an old jeep trail.  It is then about 1 mile to the trailhead.  Follow the old dirt road as it swings to the left up to a small open ridge and then climbs to Strawberry Ridge.

6.7,Point to Point,5860,4663,941,1277,6,25,BST: Dry Creek to City Creek,Intermediate/Difficult,3.4,"        Start from the Dry Creek Trail and climb the short hill, then follow the road to the horseshoe and continue straight.  There is a trail marker at the start of the trail.  The first two miles is a bit of a climb with some rocks thrown in for good measure.  About a mile up, you'll come to another horseshoe - follow this one around.  The trail is steep again and a little rocky.  

After a half mile, it starts to level out, and then becomes more rolling and follows the lay of the land into small canyons.  Around mile 2.5, you'll get a bit of an uphill climb for about a half of a mile.  Take a drink if you have water.  This is the last serious climb and continues for another mile with more rolling terrain before heading downhill for another mile.

At approximately mile 5, it turns to the right and goes into more rollers for another half mile.  It then heads downhill for the rest of the hike and you can do some controlled falling - just be wary of the rocks that will litter the trail until you get to City Creek!

3.5,Point to Point,4893,4003,1104,214,7,26,Moab Rim Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.4,"        The Moab Rim has been famous as a gnarly jeep trail for decades, but is used by many types of trail users.

This trail runs along a ledge of purplish sandstone on the anticline that rises along the Colorado River to form the cliffs defining the western side of the Moab Valley. It mirrors the infamous Portal Trail on the other side of the river, but never becomes as broken, narrow, or sandy. Basically, the Moab Rim trail is slickrock all the way to the top. This sounds like good news, but there are brutal stair-step features and the angle is absolutely relentless.

When you top out, turn around the mesa following the two-track to eventually meet up with the Hidden Valley trail.

From here, you can make a loop hike by climbing your way through the edge of Behind The Rocks Wilderness Study Area connecting to the Hidden Valley Trail, down the uber-gnarly ""Barney Rubble"", and finally utilizing Pipe Dream as your avenue back to town, though this loop is arguably easier in the other direction.

Start at the staging area near Portal on the Kane Creek road. Once you are on the trail, it's hard to get lost: just follow the black rubber streak and don't fall off into the river far below.

It climbs 2,400 feet to the 11,000 foot summit of Hidden Peak. Access begins off of Bypass Road.

The road climbs steadily. Over the first two miles, steep climbs with grades up to 20% are followed by short periods where the road levels for a bit. At mile 0.9, Rothman Way intersects.

Beginning at mile 2, the road climbs steadily and steeply for the last mile and a half. Beautiful views over the Snowbird Resort and Little Cottonwood Canyon can be appreciated on this trail.

1.6,Point to Point,7425,6907,517,0,6,18,Tropic Valley Connector,Easy/Intermediate,3.4,"        The Tropic Valley Connector is a useful way to access the amphitheaters, hoodoos, Peekaboo Loop and other valley floor rock formations without doing the steep climb back and forth to the rim.  This being said, the Tropic Valley Connector is a wide doubletrack without much scenery or shade for the first two-thirds of the way. The consistent but gentle incline eventually leads to much better views, so be patient!  

This trail starts at the fenced cul de sac at the end of Bryce Way Road (just west of the town of Tropic). Park at the end of the road where you are likely to see horses being readied for trail rides.  Proceed through scrub and trees until reaching the wide wash of Peekaboo Canyon. Here you have the choice of using the Peekaboo Connector to access the popular Peekaboo Loop or Navajo Loop trails. Alternately, you may choose to stay on Tropic Valley Connector as it heads northwest to join the Queens Garden Trail.

5.6,Point to Point,9236,5131,4193,88,14,44,Beus Canyon Trail,Difficult,3.3,"        The trail begins with a moderate two-mile hike which changes into a steep, difficult climb from the foothills east of Ogden to the ridge south of Mount Ogden.

The trail leaves the parking lot towards the mountain. This lower part of the trail climbs to the mouth of Beus Canyon where it intersects with the Bonneville Shoreline Trail going north to Weber State University. The trail continues along Beus Creek until it reaches a small meadow where the canyon forks. This meadow is locally known as Fern Valley for obvious reasons.

The trail continues on the south fork of the stream until it begins the steep climb to the ridge between Beus Canyon and Birch Canyon to the south. It stays in the dry, hot oak brush hillsides until it reaches timberline.

Then the trail goes north into the head of Beus Creek. Piles of rock, commonly called rock cairns, mark a route to the saddle south of Mount Ogden with its prominent radio tower. At this saddle you can follow the summer access road into Snowbasin Resort Area.
If you enjoy spectacular views, this is the hike for you. 

The area has outstanding geologic formations and a bounty of wildflowers throughout the spring and summer season. The trail is near the head of both Malans Basin and Taylor Canyon when it reaches Mount Ogden. Taylor Canyon is the first canyon south of Ogden Canyon so named for John Taylor who built a lime kiln at its mouth. The lower portion of both canyons is privately owned as well as very difficult terrain and we don't recommend you enter either of these canyons.

2.9,Point to Point,8907,7111,1796,0,12,28,Iron Mountain Trail,Difficult,3.5,"        This challenging hike gains its elevation quickly but steadily, so it is a good efficient workout. The first half of the trail and the latter part of the trail are for foot-traffic only.  However the middle part of the trail is now on open to mountain bikers, so hikers should be aware.

Start from the end of Iron Mountain Court and head through a couple small clearings before becoming enveloped in a huge aspen forest.  Enjoy a brief stint in pine trees as you climb ever upwards before emerging onto the open ridge just below the summit of Iron Mountain. Next, the Iron Canyon Trail crosses Mid Mountain Trail.  Originally you could reach the top of Iron Mountain by staying straight on the Iron Canyon Trail, but now there is a very large ""Private Property / No Trespassing"" sign. 

For the new route, one turns right on Mid Mountain Trail, then after a few hundred yards take the Iron Mountain Trail.  This part of the Iron Mountain Trail allows mountain biking.  After about 1.5 miles, one reaches a dirt road.  Go up this dirt road for a few hundred yards until a smaller path branches off north and heads steeply up to the Iron Mountain summit.  From here you'll have great views over the Park City and the Canyons ski area.

15.4,Point to Point,8047,5817,35,2265,3,15,Woodenshoe Trail (165),Easy/Intermediate,3.5,"        From a small clearing off of FS Road 340, the Woodenshoe Trail begins descending through a forest of pine, aspen and oak. The first mile brings hikers into the Dark Canyon Wilderness, and soon to the southern reaches of Woodenshoe Canyon.

Ahead, the trail makes its way to the bottom of the canyon floor through a section of low cliffs. The forest is dense here and makes for a pleasantly shady experience. As the trail turns to the northwest (left), look behind you to enjoy the view down Cherry Canyon. The nearby ruin is well worth checking out, and is also a good turnaround spot for a shorter out-and-back.

From here, the trail begins to follow a low depression around a stream bed as it travels through the wide canyon floor. Above, towering sandstone cliffs present a dramatic backdrop on either side. As the depression widens, the trail more frequently cuts between turns in the stream bed. 

Before the 10-mile mark, a small scramble brings hikers along a narrow limestone ledge following the contours of the canyon. At 12.8 miles, a perennial stream flows along the canyon bottom, adding to the appeal of nearby campsites. The Dark Canyon West Trail (006) is reached after a few more miles of gentle descending.

Bear left and begin the first gradual climb.The well-traveled trail will traverse some open ski runs before dipping into the forest and beginning a nice, gradual descent.

Descend through the woods and back into the open to a low point at Green Pond. After passing the pond, settle into a continuous, albeit mellow, ascent to the end of the trail. At mile 2.75, you'll cross a dirt access road. Shortly after crossing the road, you'll see Last Chance join from the left. A final jaunt on Green Pond will lead you to its terminus, again with Needles.

From here, either retrace your steps on Green Pond, enjoy a pleasant hike down Needles back to the base or turn left on Needles to continue ascending the mountain.

5.3,Point to Point,5712,5167,212,689,3,15,Phipps Wash Route,Difficult,3.5,"        There is no trail down Phipps Wash, but route finding and the hike are not very difficult, except for the side trip to Phipps Arch. Compared to the route described by Michael Kelsey in ""Canyon Hiking Guide to the Colorado Plateau"", the route described here is easier, with less elevation change. It starts from a pullout on Hwy 12 about 11.5 miles east of Escalante, Utah where the highway crosses a dry tributary to Phipps Wash. 

It is possible to hike fairly directly down the tributary, leaving the creek bed only to get around places where it drops sharply. However, the exceptionally beautiful rock formations just above should not be missed. I recommend taking the slightly longer, scenic route down to Phipps Wash and then returning by the more direct route.

From Hwy 12, climb down the gently sloping rock to the creek-bed. At about 0.3 miles, there is an easy way to climb the red-rock slopes on the right side to hundreds of yards of undulating rock formations colored with light reds and oranges mixed with the deep green of trees and bushes. This is especially beautiful in the morning sun. These formations seem little known, but they are easily reached and worth a trip by themselves.  

Explore the rocks as you head toward the left side of Hill 5840, which consists almost entirely of pink and orange rock. Hike around to the back side of Hill 5840 where there are sweeping views of upper Phipps Basin and easy slopes down to the main Phipps Wash. When you first reach it, the wash has a sharp drop, but this is easily bypassed. A little farther down, you pass the mouth of the tributary that leads back to to Hwy 12. After that, simply follow the canyon all the way down to the Escalante River. 

The middle part of Phipps Wash is fairly wide, with orange sandstone walls on both sides. As much as possible, avoid the deep sand in the center by hiking on firmer sand or rocks along the sides.  

At around four miles, you reach a major side canyon on the right (east) side. On the far side of the canyon's mouth, there is a trail marked with cairns that leads up the slick rock to Phipps Arch. This trail has ledges and sections that are very steep, especially near the top.

On the return trip, at the mouth of the tributary leading to Hwy 12, avoid an impassible section just upstream by   scrambling up the far (south) side of the mouth to the top of the canyon. Return to the creek bed where possible. When you see the two other impassible sections, simply hike up the side around them.

There isn't too much strenuous elevation gain/loss and the tread is relatively easy along grippy slickrock. Wayfinding is aided by large cairns and a good line of sight makes it relatively easy to know you're at least headed in the right direction.

It follows an old road climb at the beginning and then drops to the mouth of the canyon after one mile. The trail in the canyon is wide with a gentle incline, and it is shaded by scrub oak, making it a pleasant hike even in hot weather.

As you proceed, you'll pass some old stock tanks and an abandoned trailer, until you reach a small meadow at around mile two; from here the old road ends, and the trail narrows. You eventually reach an old stock pond and the end of the canyon at around three miles in. At this point, the hike becomes even more difficult; a little trail proceeds on and begins a steep climb up to the ridge. The trail has a few switchbacks up the hill until eventually you go through some big Juniper trees where the trail ends on the ridge at a no trespassing sign and an awesome view.

Follow the wash for the length of this trail.  Occasional cairns directing you out of the wash mark shortcuts around obstacles.  Initially, the rock walls are distant and you travel through open fields of desert scrub and pinion.  Keep an eye out for a natural stone arch high on the north side of the trail about 0.5-mile from the trailhead.  

As you proceed uphill along the trail, the canyon walls approach gradually and soon the canyon begins to form around you, growing deeper and narrower.  Huge mountains of slickrock appear in the distance.   After about 2 miles, hike through the Moenkopi Shale formation where you may see a seep on the right side of the trail. Water leaks out of the base  of the rock, providing enough water for the cottonwoods but not enough to drink.

At approximately 0.45 miles, there is a junction; take the right turn uphill here.  About 0.25 miles later you'll intersect the service road.  The singletrack continues uphill about 50 feet north of the intersection here.

From the intersection of the service road, it is about 1.1 miles to the highest point of the trail.  There are some smaller rocky sections and a few exposed spots along this segment.

Continuing north, you'll soon pass above the 9th Street climbing wall, and beyond this the trail gets a bit more rocky with a few lengthier sections of talus.  1.4 miles from the high-point, you'll intersect the intersection of the Jumpoff Canyon South Trail.

It has it all; great views, easy climbing, and a sustained mellow downhill.  By itself, the JEM is an out-and back trail, but can be combined with Goulds Rim, or the Hurricane Rim trail, to make loops over 20 miles.

The lower trailhead can be a little hard to find, but the MTB Project mobile app should lead you right to it. Traveling east on State Road 9 turn right onto Sheep Bridge Road (just before you enter Virgin, Utah). Cross over the Virgin River on the bridge and take the first right after the cattle guard. Follow the two track about a half mile to the end (this is the trailhead and parking). 

There can be 2-way traffic, so keep your eyes open. Most of the time, there is a good line-of-sight making it easy to avoid problems.

The trail starts as you leave the parking lot heading west along the rim above the Virgin River. There are many great views of the river with Zion National Park in the background. The trail is obvious here, but after the trail bends south and leaves the canyon it joins a dirt road and it can be a little confusing (mile 1.3). Go right (west) on the road for about 100 yards until you cross a (usually) dry wash. Turn left after the wash and look for the brown trail sign to get back onto the singletrack. 

At mile 1.6, you'll come to the Hurricane Rim trail junction - stay left on the JEM trail.  As you continue, you'll cross a few double tracks, but the singletrack is obvious on the other side.  At Mile 4.5 the singletrack crosses a well maintained gravel road. If you are doing the JEM as an out-and-back, cross the gravel road and continue on the trail on the other side.  Follow the singletrack until you come to a super steep hill.  This is the JEM drops.  You can turn around here and start the descent back, or a little ways further up the hill and continue to the upper parking lot.  If you continue on, you'll hit another short, steep uphill before the trail mellows out on the way to the upper parking.  

Whenever you turn around, that's where the real fun begins. Since the trail is completely downhill the whole way back you can just take it easy and enjoy the desert scenery. It can be traveled in both directions, but most prefer to save the downhill for last.  Some people do shuttle the trail so that they only have to hike one direction.

As you near the eastern end of this section, there is a three-way intersection in a small canyon--left/north will take you up the Mt. Van Cott Trail, and right/south will take you to the Red Butte Skyline Trail (Rough Riders) and/or other singletrack options that parallel Red Butte Canyon Road (with the option to head directly for Red Butte Canyon Road if desired).

5.2,Point to Point,7270,5436,1834,274,8,21,Old Jardine Juniper Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.5,"        This trail goes up through several types of landscapes, including pine and aspen forests and sagebrush meadows and ends up going around a knoll with great views of the mountains in the area, and ends up finishing at the oldest living tree in the area, a juniper that is supposedly over 1500 years old. 

For the first couple of miles, the trail slowly creeps up through a sagebrush meadow with great views all around of the forests and mountains that surround the area. The trail is a pretty steadily incline, but allows for hiking and there aren't many technical spots at all, as the trail is well-maintained. 

Although it never gets very technical, it is still a very fun trail, especially on the way down because the grades never get too steep and so you can get going really quickly.

3.3,Point to Point,5558,5156,422,37,3,15,BST: Orem to Provo Canyon,Intermediate,3.5,"        Park at the Orem Bench Trailhead, at the north end of 800 East above the water tanks. At the east edge of the parking lot, there is a level singletrack, which soon connects to a dirt access road. The road climbs significantly until it turns a corner into the canyon, then is very level.
    ",UT
5.3,Point to Point,8379,6948,1534,243,6,22,Stump Hollow,Intermediate,3.5,"        From the trailhead, a sign can be seen that says ""Stump Hollow - 5 miles"". Follow the trail that goes from this sign into the woods beyond. In the woods, the trail immediately starts ascending, although it is a very gradual ascent that continues throughout the first three miles of the trail. The first part of the trail is very interesting because there is a mixture of large rocks and forest, aspen and pine, and it's all very beautiful. The trail itself is also interesting because I believe it was renovated for mountain bikers, so there are several berms and bumps that would probably be really fun on a mountain bike, and are pretty fun on foot as well. After a couple of miles, the trail starts to switchback up a hillside, and as the switchbacks reach the top of their ascent, the view opens up to where you get a great view of Gog and Magog, as well as the cirque headwall right above White Pine Lake, to the west. Mount Naomi sits in the backdrop as well. 

At this point, most of the climbing has been done and the trail drops into a pretty flat section through a beautiful conifer forest as it contours around a mountain, and eventually drops down into a large deforested basin with a small pond to the right of the trail. This is a beautiful area, especially in the morning as the sunlight breaks through and shines on the dew that rests on the grasses and sagebrush in the basin. However, just as quickly as the forest opened up into the basin, it swallows the trail again as it ascends slowly to the high point of the trail. From the high point in the forest, the trail drops quickly via a set of short switchbacks into the Peter Sinks area, which is a great contrast to the forest that the trail has been going through for most of its course. Peter Sinks is a vast, almost treeless basin with expansive views in all directions. It has a lot of sagebrush and grasses, but trees only very sparsely populate this area, which is most likely due to the temperatures. On just about any given day, the sinks are generally about 10-15 degrees cooler than the surrounding areas. It is a great area though. 

After dropping into the Peter Sinks area, the trail continues for another half mile or so, passing by large cairns (many of them are about 2 feet tall) along a really neat rocky ridge that separates two parts of the sinks, which allows for great views of the talus in the sinks, as well as the rock outcroppings above. The trail ends at a sign and converges with a dirt road.

The trail twists and turns and has some short and mellow climbs. Unlike most Moab area trails, there are not a lot of rocks to encounter so consider this your warm up into UPS and LPS.

2.8,Point to Point,7342,5953,1403,26,10,33,Steel Hollow Trail,Intermediate,3.5,"        From the junction of the Rick's Canyon Trail, the Steel Hollow Trail ascends into the mouth of Steel Hollow. From here you can see some fantastic evidence of the erosion that has occurred in this canyon as it has cut through layers of bedrock to form its mouth. As you continue ascending you'll enter a section that is wooded on your right side, but almost barren on the left side with intermittent sharp rock formations. 

As you continue up the trail it can start to become overgrown late in the season, but it never gets too bad as there is a decent amount of traffic up this trail. Although it is a short trail, there are some really great rock formations and flowers to see on your way up. Once at the top, the trail meets up with the Long Hollow Road where you can see forests and meadows in all directions.

There are lots of rocks in the more open treeless areas, but the trail smooths out every time you enter into the trees. Along the way, the singletrack intersects several other trails.

It can be traveled either direction, as both have tough climbs and steep descents. But, south to north as mapped is generally more fun. Whichever direction you travel, most hikes will begin or end at the Skyline - Big John Flat Trailhead even though there is roughly a mile-and-a-half more trail to the west.

There are a couple of rocky sections, but for the most part the singletrack is well maintained and smooth, with an easy grade all the way down (or up). From the Potato Hill Trailhead, head to the left (west), and you'll catch this trail pretty quickly, and it almost immediately starts descending on a pretty open hillside (not much in the way of trees or vegetation). The trail gives some decent views of the Salt Lake Valley and the surrounding mountains since it is pretty open.

A series of small creek crossings follow one after the other and a larger wash sits immediately before a sand-covered protrusion. Two more creek crossings proceed a split in the road-trace, where you'll follow the trail to the right to soon arrive at the Muley Tanks and the fairly reliable source of water they hold (needs treatment).

From the tanks, keep along the main path as it begins to circle to the west. The route gets indistinct here, but hikers are headed for the closest point of a nearby long sandstone ramp. After scrambling to the top, the red ""hamburger"" formations can be seen perched above the surrounding white sandstone.

Once you've enjoyed the Hamburger Rocks and the tanks, return the way you came, and continue on to either the Lower Muley Twist Canyon Trail or the Halls Creek Drainage.

From the parking area, head west over the mesa top to the edge of White Canyon, where there is a short descent at the very end near the edge. This viewing area is fenced off to prevent falls. From this perspective you can see the remains of an ancestral Puebloan cliff dwelling in a large alcove near the bottom of the canyon. The structures are tucked into a circular depression. Two granaries with uniquely shaped doors give this ruin its name. No one seems to know why the doors were shaped this way, but there is evidence of many fires being built in this structure.

To the left of the granaries is a square kiva, the community’s ceremonial and meeting room. It is very rare for structures to still have intact roofs. Binoculars or a zoom lens will aid viewing. Ancestral Puebloans, or Anasazi, inhabited this area of Utah for over 1,000 years, and their abrupt departure from the area remains a mystery.

It will also connect to the new trail going down Hog Hollow Road. The trail is still new, so it needs some time to pack down, but it’s getting better by the day. This one is a little more winding than other trails around here, and there are more obstacles that many of the other trails, which keeps things exciting.

This trail starts on the Bonneville Shoreline Trail at the point going north where you're stopped by a sign that tells you to go no further unless, of course, you're not worried about either 1) getting shot, or 2) being prosecuted for trespassing. It's a shame that the Bonneville Shoreline Trail is cut off at this point. However, you don't have to turn back. Find the switchback that goes up the mountain. This is the trail to Eddie's Flat.

Once your reach the flat, there are at least two ways to continue. You can head north to a campsite with some supplies cached (please leave what you find), or you can head west along the north ridge of Bair Canyon.

3.8,Point to Point,8337,6446,1905,24,10,51,Mill Canyon #40,Intermediate/Difficult,3.5,"        Mill Canyon #40 is a scenic and challenging route that ascends from the American River to the Ridge Trail #157. 

Start by crossing a bridge and then following the creek along the bottom of Mill Canyon. Within the first mile, you'll hike through a mix of forest types and see some of Northern Utah's red rock formations.

As the route ascends, it breaks away from the creek on its way to an intersection with Mud Spring. Continue straight and rejoin the creek for a easy section.

It's also the best way to gain the final section of ridgline leading to Thurston Peak. I would also add that this is a fantastic snowshoeing route in winter. I've seen ski tracks on it too and mountain lion tracks. I've also seen flea-ridden moose and deer tracks in the snow. Try to go around these to avoid bringing fleas home with you.

The trail follows the ridge proper until it encounters a cliffy, mid-ridge peak, the south side of which skirts it and traverses until it reaches the cabin. Along this traverse, you pass under a saddle and a false peak that is the start of the ridge to Thurston Peak. You can enjoy hiking and scrambling the north or south shoulder of this false peak with ease.

In winter, there is a wonderful alpine feeling here, and ice-axe and crampons may come in handy.

The first mile or so of the trail is rolling singletrack that winds around the rocky outer cropping of rocks above Salt Valley. It winds nicely around big rock formations on hardpacked dirt - even going in between a two very large rocks tilted together. The switchbacks are smooth and the views are spectacular.

The Alaska Trail descent follows a slight ridge line and is mainly on slickrock and salt wash sandstone.

Two other trails exit off of Alaska: Homer and Nome, making for lots of hiking options. If you don't want the downhill to end quite yet, instead of finishing on Alaska, take Homer all the way down to Dino-Flow for a total of a 1.7 mile descent. You can also exit down to Dino-Flow via Nome at the first intersection you come across. The full Alaska trail finishes on Mega Steps at the EKG intersection slightly above the Dino-Flow intersection.

The shortest hike option for this trail is to go up Mega Steps and then take Alaska down for a 6.5 mile loop total.

2.6,Point to Point,9300,8127,1248,74,10,37,Ontario Canyon,Intermediate,3.3,"        The Deer Valley and Park City areas can feel overrun with mountain bikers, but the Ontario Canyon Trail is designated a foot-traffic only trail, so you're guaranteed more peace and quiet.  One popular way to do this trail involves taking the Sterling Express chairlift up and hiking down. Alternatively, if you hike up, you can ride the lift down for free.

Starting from the top of the Sterling Express lift, go right (southwest) on a wide dirt service road to contour around the top of Bald Mountain.  After 2 bends on this road (also called the Homeward Bound ski run), branch off to follow signs for the Ontario Canyon Trail.  There are a lot of other trails and many junctions in this open scrubby field.  Initially, you'll have to travel on some switchbacking mountain bike trails (Naildriver or Homeward Bound are good options) for a short ways to reach the start of the Ontario Canyon Trail.  (if you can't navigate the short bike trails to the start of Ontario Canyon trail, it is OK to just take the Homeward Bound ski run or the Homeward Bound bike trail down until it meets at the valley junction described below)

Once on the Ontario Canyon Trail, you'll hike steeply downhill towards the snowmaking pond just west of the Bald Mountain summit and its numerous chairlift termini.  Pass along the pond's eastern edge and join the Homeward Bound ski run again briefly.  Emerge from the forest into a valley clearing where the Ontario ski run diverges from the Homeward Bound ski run.  Take the wide, sunny Ontario Canyon trail all the way downhill until just before a large set of ski area maintenance buildings appears ahead.  Stay on the dirt road that skirts the right (east) side of this complex. The loop ends at the bottom of the Sterling Express chairlift at the Silver Lake Village base area.

The road is gravelly for the first couple miles, after which it becomes more rocky with some very sandy sections.

Go as far as you like, then return the way you came, or tie into one of the many other trails in the area. This trail links into a large network of trails in the Prostitute Butte (aka Lone Rock) area, with options to connect to Hunter Canyon, Pritchett Canyon, 24-Hours of Moab Racecourse and Behind the Rocks. 

Make sure to check out Prostitute Butte while you're in the area; this large Entrada sandstone formation boasts two arches and some impressive alcoves.  As far as Prostitute Butte, the road is easy. Beyond, it becomes moderate.

About 3.5-miles after Prostitute Butte, the road begins to parallel the Kane Canyon Rim. There are some beautiful overlooks out on left turn spur roads in this stretch. 

At roughly 6-miles past Prostitute Butte, the road bends right, away from the rim and drops down another 3-miles to a large cottonwood wash. Here, if you wish to continue all the way to the Colorado River rather than retracing your steps, you must decide whether you'll exit via Hunter Canyon Rim (left), or Pritchett Canyon (right).

Unfortunately, this gate is always locked and (although everyone is free to go and use this trail) you'll need to jump over the fence or the gate to get onto the trail. 

The trail itself drops down to where Millville Creek crosses under the road through a culvert, and you approach another gate that needs to be jumped over. Luckily, this is the last one of the trail. Once you pass the gate, the trail starts to go up and down the rolling foothills of the Bear River Range as it heads toward Blacksmith Fork Canyon.

The first couple of miles are fairly easy with not much elevation change, and then as the last mile approaches a couple of steep drops occur as the trail drops down the terraces of the Blacksmith Fork River and down to water level. Eventually, the river comes into view and then passes right by the trail (on the other side of the deer fence) which is scenic and beautiful. 

Soon after, the trail narrows down to singletrack that goes up and over some rocky parts and then drops down into a very shady section with some thick trees around it. There is a gate that is locked in the winter when the elk are calving in the Millville Face Wildlife Management Area, but it is open during the rest of the year. Go through this gate and the trail goes up and around a spring that feeds a small creek that flows into the Blacksmith Fork River (and if you take the trail that goes closest to the small fence, you can avoid a small creek crossing). The trail eventually drops back into the shaded forested area, and then crosses a small fence to get to the parking area in Blacksmith Fork Canyon.

This trail is a great, easy trail and a fun way of getting to Blacksmith Fork Canyon from other parts of the valley. It also offers great views of Cache Valley and the surrounding mountains (Gunsight Peak, the Wellsvilles, etc.) and you can often see deer along the route if you go early enough in the morning.

9.7,Point to Point,4785,3974,1378,567,4,19,Hurrah Pass,Intermediate,3.3,"        This is a good hike for those days when you want to get out in a beautiful place, but just don't have the killer instinct for anything too demanding. You can always drive further out to start your trip to match your energy level.

The hike begins at the mouth of Kane Creek and follows the graded gravel Kane Springs road through the magnificent winding sandstone walls. In about 4-miles, the canyon begins to widen. In another 3-miles or so, the road will cross Kane Creek, bear right, and begin climbing up toward the pass. 

Whatever you do, don't continue following the creek: this route out to Highway-191 turns desperately sandy in short order.

As you continue toward the pass, on the high mesa above your left shoulder is the Anticline Overlook a 35-mile drive on dirt roads to access. Sometimes you can see people up there.

Reaching Hurrah Pass, enjoy the river view. Continue on to Chicken Corners or Lockhart Basin on worsening road, or retrace your path.

Be advised that the Kane Springs road is a popular camping area and a major thoroughfare, providing access to many biking, OHV, and rock climbing options. Hike to Hurrah Pass on a weekday or off-season if you don't want the noise, dust and fumes of dozens of passing vehicles.

1.6,Point to Point,4596,4246,350,0,4,6,Crater Spur Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.3,"        The out-and-back Crater Spur Trail leaves from the western side of the Syncline Loop Trail and travels eastwards into the actual crater of the Upheaval Dome.  Follow cairns through a dry wash, leaving it only occasionally to get around large outcrops or drop offs.  The trail ends at a signpost.  From here you can go off trail to poke around in earth that was once 1000 feet underground.  You can also get up close to the jumbled pile of rock that was pushed up in the center of the crater (called a rebound peak).  

Geologists are not sure, but most think the Upheaval Dome was caused by a meteorite 500-1000 feet across hitting the earth, causing a crater and then erosion slowly reshaping the land.  Another theory is that a thick layer of salt deposited by ancient seas was  pushed up through layers of rock creating a salt bubble that eroded away over time.  The presence of shocked quartz has led most to believe the meteorite explanation.

The singletrack trail climbs the west face of the Stansbury Island mountain to the top of the ridge. The trail is hard-packed but liberally coated with round quartzite boulders and chunks of limestone. The combination of steep grade (15%) and rocky trail will challenge you. From here, hikers will be looking west over the shallow west end of the Great Salt Lake.

The trail descends about 200 feet from the ridge, then hugs the shoulder of a horizontal band of conglomerate as it follows the canyons carved into the south face of the mountain. The canyon walls are rocky and steep, with exposed cliff areas.

After following the shoulder where the limestone and dolomite meets the conglomerate layer around two canyons, the trail splits and one branch descends back to the lake shore. Keep left to continue on the shoulder area further around the island.

The trail suddenly ends right before cliff with great views to Great Salt Lake.

This quickly turns to singletrack as you approach Spawn Creek. Spawn Creek can be crossed through a wide shallow area, or you can follow the water's edge up to the right and cross on a narrow bridge.  

Once past the creek, the trail starts to climb as you move along Spawn Creek. The trail has some areas with loose rock, downed trees (thanks to the beavers), and small and large holes (thanks to ground squirrels. There are several areas with beaver dams and this can often lead to sections of the trail becoming boggy. It often becomes difficult to continue on the trail past a couple of miles due to lack of use and occasional flooding of the trail area, however intrepid hikers can push on to the trail's terminus at FR 252.

After passing this gate, the trail continues to ascend and crosses a dry creek and goes in and out of the forest as it goes toward the head of the Willow Creek drainage.

Eventually, the trail switches back to cross another small, ephemeral creek drainage gaining elevation above Willow Creek on this small switchback. From this point, the trail still parallels the creek from above, on the hillside. Soon after this switchback the trail passes an interesting, large rock that sits on the right-hand side of the trail. 

From this point, the trail continues along the hillside until it eventually drops back closer to the creek. About a mile from the start of the trail (where it broke off of the Right Hand Fork Logan River Trail) the trail passes a junction that crosses the creek and goes over to the Ephraim's Cutoff Trail. 

Continue on the main trail to the left as it goes through a small aspen forest. The trail continues on to the Northeast, heading toward the springs at the head of the Willow Creek drainage. The incline is constant but is pleasant and easily navigable until the trail eventually ends at the Temple Fork Road FR007.

8.2,Point to Point,5039,4022,1271,254,4,18,Poison Spider Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.0,"        Poison Spider is seemingly on everyone's bucket list, but it's not for everyone.  It's not too difficult, but the deep sand makes the miles feel long. This trail is very popular with Jeeps, so avoid Jeep Jamboree weekends especially (weekdays are pretty empty). However, there's a lot of fun slickrock, and the scenery is just incredible.

From the parking lot (first take a look at the dinosaur tracks on the east end), start up the dirt road, which is impassible for normal cars but popular with Jeeps. It's not overly steep or technical, though near the top there's a short section with lots of large, loose rocks.

Once you reach the plateau in about two miles, the trail becomes much less steep but there are now many ledges and long sandy spots over the next mile.  The edge of the trail, the path continues to widen, and is over 50' wide in places!

After the sand pits, the slickrock fun begins.  You hike and up and down many domes, generally trending uphill.  There are several ledges that are high steps down.  After about 3.5 miles, you are now high on the plateau and the scenery gets awesome.  Rock fin formations, the city of Moab, and the La Sal mountains spread out before you.

At mile 5.5 there is a 100 yard trail to view ""Little Arch"".  This is a popular place to turn around if you're getting tired, though the trail is actually better from here to the end, so stick with it if you have the energy!

When you hit the fork in the road that says ""PS"" and has arrows pointing in both directions, go RIGHT.  The left option is for Jeeps doing a loop.

The final couple of miles have quite a bit of climbing up steep slickrock.  It's amazing what you can stick to though; you'll be on top soon.  It's a really fun section.

At trail's end, you hit the Portal trail at the edge of the plateau.  You now have three options:
Turn around and return the way you came (which is how this trail is mapped).Turn left and loop around the Golden Spike, which reunites with Poison Spider about halfway back.Turn right and descend the treacherous Portal trail.  Recommended for experts only.

For the first portion of this trail, hikers will follow the Right Hand Fork Logan River Trail. After the trail leaves the Right Hand Fork Logan River Trail, it starts following an intermittent stream that runs strongly in the spring but often dries up by the summer after the snow melts. The trail slowly winds up, following the creek bed for a little bit over a mile, and the visible terrain slowly opens up to sprawling meadows and hills. The trail eventually heads up toward a saddle and meets up with the Little Cottonwood Trail, where you can get great views of surrounding areas, including parts of the northern Bear River Range.

This trail is great on its own as an out-and-back or it can be combined with the Little Cottonwood Trail to create an excellent loop.

This trail was completed in 2012 and parts of the new trail were resurrected from an old Park City High School cross-country trail that had been out of use for years. 

Park off Road 224, head under the underpass, pass the barn and take the Farm Trail west to its intersection with the McPolin Trail.  This trail runs through the woods behind the famous Park City landmark, the McPolin/Osguthorpe White Barn.  This farmland was first homesteaded in 1886 and the barn was built in 1908 from recycled timber salvaged from an old mine tailings mill.  This huge 7468 square foot barn was made without using nails and the 1500 square foot milking barn was added in the 1950's.  The farmland and barn were purchased by the citizens of Park City in 1990 to conserve the open space and history of this area.

We were there the weekend after Labor Day and there wasn't anyone camping there. There is no water at the trailhead, make sure you bring plenty for the hike. We saw a huge mule deer buck and cows along the trail and also signs of a mountain lion (two mule deer carcasses around mile 5), be advised to keep children and dogs close. 

The trail is well marked, but has a LOT of rocks, hiking poles are recommended. There are many places along the trail to camp.

The trail makes a slow and steady climb up from the parking area through the forest, with limited views the first two miles and is fairly well shaded. 

Just past the second mile, the trail runs along a ridge with very nice views to the north and west of the surrounding area. From here until about mile eight, you'll be hiking mostly in the sun. 

At mile three, you leave the views behind and pass through a large meadow and cross a small seasonal creek. The trail continues the steady climb until around mile six with occasional views to the north and west. The trail steepens slightly here and continues another mile and you start to see views to the east and down into Leeds/Hurricane area of Utah. 

The trail continues to climb into the forest along the ridge with views mostly to the west, until mile 16, with a small descent around mile 10. You can catch views of Pine Valley and Gardner Peaks to the west.

The trail then continues to climb up through very rocky areas, then across several meadows, crossing a small stream (Further Water) until you you reach the branch ""trail"" for Signal Peak. The views up there are nice, but trees and terrain block a lot of the view.

The return trip can be made via the Pine Valley Trail or Oak Grove Trail (currently closed).

0.6,Loop,5085,5066,25,25,2,3,Pothole Point Trail,Easy,3.0,"        Parking is available right at the trailhead. I suggest doing the loop clockwise, but either way would be fine. 

The route runs mostly over flat slabs of rock, with some dusty areas at the beginning (and end). This is a short and simple trail. Make sure to follow the cairns (stacks of rocks). Those are the trail markers. Please don't wander into the dusty areas that have a black cryptobiotic crust on top as it is alive. It's easily damaged by foot traffic and is an important part of the local ecosystem. 

The first 50 or so feet of the trail you are ascending (very slightly). As you get up on the flat slabs that make up most of the trail, you can see The Needles area off to your left. You can also see lots of the soil crust off to your left as well. You'll see where people have walked out in it and damaged it. The damage almost makes it look like trails have been made. The trail DOES NOT go through the soil crust toward The Needles. 

As you continue on the trail (turning right as you round a large rock outcropping), you get great views of the western side of the park in the distance and can see some really unique valleys and rock formations nearby. You'll also notice some cool sandstone rocks that almost look like modern art sculptures to your right. The whole time you are on the slab rock portion of the trail, you can see why they call the trail Potholes. If it's rained recently, these potholes in the rock may still have some water in them. Like the soil crust, these little water reservoirs are an important part of the ecosystem. Enjoy!

After just over half a mile, the trail tops a low ridge and turns to the northwest. From this high point, a good view back to the northeast includes Mt. Ellen, fronted by the Mancos Shale of Wildcat Mesa. The grade continues to be very modest as the old road goes up the ridge, leveling out at the top, where it turns to the southwest, and then back to the north. The huge amphitheater that is at the head of Red Canyon looms to the west, while incised gullies fade off to the south in the Entrada Sandstone. 

Further on, the trail, still following the roadbed, begins to descend moderately to the north and then a little more steeply when it swings to the west. At the bottom of the dugway, it directly crosses the Red Canyon wash and ends where it re-enters the drainage at a big cottonwood tree. If you are continuing in the wash, this is a good place to note for the return trip; usually, it is marked by a cairn, as well.

See Red Canyon for details regarding the trek up Red Canyon wash.

It is great for getting down to North Ogden or Eden from hiking the Skyline Trail.  

The west side from the divide goes down singletrack through the trees for about the first mile. Keep your eye out as you descend, as there are roots and rocks that are hidden by the grass at the edges of the trail. There is one bridge to cross and a few switchbacks.  

The trail then follows the dirt road that has a lot of loose rock in spots to the trailhead at the east end of 2750 North.

From the trailhead, follow the sandy track down a half mile to a stream crossing near Indian Creek. This steady descent is the steepest one on the entire trail.

As you follow along the banks of Indian Creek, the trail soon begins to curve tightly back and fourth through the vegetation that fills the bottom of the canyon. The result is a delightful creek-side scene beneath dappled shade. As you enjoy the sights, notice that the slope of Shay Mountain is much dryer than the opposite slope to your right.

Around four miles in, the lush vegetation gives way to clumps of sagebrush as the trail heads toward the Manti-La Sal National Forest boundary. The trail continues through BLM land along a road until it reaches State Route 211 near Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument.

6.7,Point to Point,5459,5211,431,183,2,11,Escalante River: Little Death Hollow to Highway 12,Intermediate/Difficult,3.0,"        The Escalante riverbed is sandy, wide, and shallow and the valley is enclosed by Navajo sandstone. I've edited my GPS track to more closely follow the actual trail but, in practice, you'll probably zigzag across the riverbed as things catch your eye. Don't be surprised if you develop a preference for the south side where the most interesting features are. 

Look for the Escalante Natural Bridge along the way, as well as an Anasazi cliff dwelling slightly west of the bridge, which include petroglyphs, and a crescent shaped Escalante Natural Arch another 0.4 miles further west. This hike is ideal in the fall, e.g. early October, when yellow leaves are framed by enormous varnished sandstone walls.

The trail starts at the upper end of the campground road. After just a hundred feet or so is an intersection; the official trail goes left (down then upstream), although going straight also goes the same general direction. Go straight through the junction a quarter mile later. 

At the one mile mark, there is a grotto of sorts beneath large rocks; rest here because the steepest climb is ahead. The trail then leaves the canyon floor to the left up a very steep staired switchback. Eventually, the trail returns to the canyon floor. The trail continues upstream to a saddle at the top of the canyon. Here, there is a great view up Spanish Fork Canyon. 

From here, a faint trail continues to the right (south) over another saddle to Water Canyon, which can eventually connect all the way to Santaquin Peak and the Nebo Loop.

3.6,Point to Point,4731,4222,528,31,3,37,Butler Canyon Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        This route is one of the day-tripping opportunities between Hite and Hanksville. The rich riparian growth makes this trail occasionally very challenging throughout the first half. 

To get started, park near UT 95 and follow the remnants of a doubletrack road for about 600 feet until you reach the canyon wash. There is usually very little or no water in Butler Canyon, which leaves a lot of sand and makes hiking moderately strenuous throughout the entire trail. Tall grasses and willow thickets will equally slow you down. 

After 1.2 miles, you'll reach a pour-off that you need to bypass on the right. Climb onto the scaling ledges early on to get to higher ground. Keep right afterwards when a major side canyon opens on the left. The thickets can be nearly impenetrable here. After about 1.7 miles, Butler Canyon assumes the more typical character of a desert canyon, which makes navigating the route a lot easier. Use the slickrock to get around most of the sand.

Two more side canyons open up on the left, but stay to the right. At the last fork, Butler Canyon continues on the left. Follow the right fork and you'll reach an alcove after 500 feet. Right before the alcove, there is a barely noticeable path up a very rocky slope. Carefully ascend the slope to gain the ridge where panoramas of the Henry Mountains await you.

Follow it up into Corner Canyon, and make the first right.  Continue on this trail for about 3/4 of a mile where the trail splits.  If you continue left, you end up on Potato Hill Trail so you'll want to veer right.  

Stay on this trail for another mile or so where it crosses a road.  Eventually, you'll end up at another trail junction where you'll want to veer left and continue through a large tunnel underneath a road.  From here, the trail will eventually cross another neighborhood road and intersect with Ann's Trail. Make a right, and then follow the trail until it ends at the Flight Park State Recreation Area.  Alternatively, you can do this trail in reverse.

The Goulds Rim trail is about 70% buff and narrow singletrack. The remainder is doubletrack. It's mostly a gradual climb up, and a fun twisty downhill on the way back.  As with all of the trails in the Hurricane, Utah area, there are great vistas in almost every direction.  You're at the doorstep of Zion National Park.

From Hurricane City, go south on US-59 up the hill above town for almost a mile.  Watch for the Hurricane Rim trailhead on your left.  The parking area shares space with cell phone towers.  Starting from the Hurricane Rim trailhead, you'll backtrack down the highway for about 1000 feet.  Be careful on the highway because the shoulder is very narrow.  Turn onto the doubletrack on your left and climb about two miles and then watch for the singletrack to branch off on the right as you reach the top of the hill.

Once on the singletrack you'll cross a few doubletracks, but the trail is obvious on the other side and often marked by signs.  At about 3 miles you'll see a corral on your left, continue past the corral on its south side and look for the brown trail sign leading you back into the singletrack going east.

This trail passes through aspen forests and goes gradually up and down as it crosses drainages on its way to the saddle between Little Baldy and Temple Baldy. It is a very pretty trail, especially in the fall when the colors have changed, but is also nice in the summer when the forest gives plenty of shade. 

Eventually, the trail breaks out of the forest and reaches the ridge at the saddle that was previously mentioned. From here, the trail offers some amazing views of Cache Valley and the Wellsville Mountains, as well as some of the surrounding ridges. From here, the trail starts to descend gradually towards the Providence Canyon drainage for about a half of a mile until it meets up with the Welches Flat Road FR 152, which eventually meets up with the Providence Canyon FR022 road and goes down into Providence Canyon.

1.2,Point to Point,5842,5794,75,73,2,6,Grand Parade Trail,Easy/Intermediate,3.0,"        The Grand Parade Trail starts from the same parking lot as the Panorama Trail - Main Loop. It is a pleasant flat loop trail that is good for families and children. 

Turn right at the main loop, which begins a short distance from the parking lot. The trail passes among pinyon pine and Utah juniper and smaller semi-desert plants such as sage, rabbitbrush, and Indian paintbrush. It mostly runs next to red-rock cliffs that are part of the Entrada layer, formed from sedimentary deposits laid down during the Jurassic Period. It passes both small and towering pipes, which are narrow towers of harder rock that were left behind as the surrounding softer rock eroded away.  

The special feature of this trail is that it enters two box canyons. Box canyons have a single narrow entrance leading to a wide area that is completely surrounded by high cliffs. I was expecting something small, bounded by low red rock cliffs. Instead, I was astounded by their actual size. These are true box canyons surrounded by cliffs over 800 feet high. In both cases, the trail goes in a little ways to the main opening of the box. From there, it is possible to continue a short distance up little side canyons, but they quickly become impassible unless you are a rock climber.   

Once you have exited the second box canyon, you have seen the primary features and it is only a short distance to a junction where you can either turn left to return back to the parking lot or turn right to go towards the Basin Campground or to connect to the Angel's Palace Trail.

Starting at a trail signpost from the unnamed ""emergency access road"" just off Home Run Court, the trail initially skirts open fields with views of the Jordanelle Reservoir far below. Switchbacking down across ski runs and through scrubby sparse trees, the trail gains momentum as it dashes past the mega-mansions of the Deer Crest neighborhood. 

The exciting descent continues with some steep turns at mile 0.75 before a breather of flatter, mellow terrain through mature aspen groves.  Once you pass under the Jordanelle Gondola line and join the valley streambed, prepare for a speedy, twisty romp! Spin Cycle bucks and churns up and down short, steep pitches, crossing the stream multiple times. 

Emerge from the aspens, pass the ski maintenance shed, and continue down the ski run through a skier tunnel and hooking a right to join the Jordanelle ski run down to the Jordanelle Gondola base area.

2.5,Point to Point,9650,8732,1197,307,11,45,White Canyon Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.0,"        Branch off the Box Elder Trail (which circumnavigates around the south end of Box Elder summit) and head northwest. This trail is one of the least used in the area, but it is generally easy to follow. The trail moves along the east and northeast slopes of Box Elder crossing several moderately steep faces as you work towards the wide box elder saddle. 

*Note: This first 2/3's of the route crosses several notoriously volatile avalanche slide zones. Because of this, the trail should be done only after a significant portion of the snow is melted. Depending on the year, June is typically a safe bet for hiking. Regardless, use caution and consider using the Deer Creek Trail to reach the saddle.

Once you reach the ridgeline, you have the option of following the branch off south towards the summit of Box Elder. To finish the trail and reach the saddle crossroads, continue north following the obvious track along the ridge. After mild elevation gain, you'll soon reach the crossroads at a large meadow along the northern most edge of the saddle. Trails leaving this crossroads lead east, down to the Granite Flats Campground, west, down Dry Creek Trail to the city of Alpine, or north, to the peak Unnamed 11,036ft.

The road is very sandy and crosses the wash numerous times. The beginning of the road can be missed very easily; it starts where Wolverine Loop Road leaves the Horse Canyon wash. 

The mouth of the canyon is fairly wide with cottonwood trees on either side. After about 1 mile, the road makes a sharp left turn south and enters a very open area with numerous small contributing washes. At 6 miles, the canyon starts to narrow and becomes very winding. 

The next 3 miles are the most interesting with amazing sandstone formations on both sides. After 9 miles, the canyon widens again. You reach the confluence with Wolverine Creek at 11.2 miles.

1.7,Point to Point,7759,7109,13,662,7,23,Sweeney's Switchbacks,Difficult,3.0,"        Sweeney's Switchbacks starts mid-way up the mountain, near the top of the King's Crown  Terrain Park.  This initial section of trail has tight narrow switchbacks that don't seem to be used very often - probably because you are above the bottom of John's Trail.  This section is difficult going and not worth climbing up unless you need to hike every inch of it.

Where Sweeney's Switchbacks hits John's Trail, it becomes somewhat rocky for a while, making for difficult footing.   But then the trail opens up and gets easier and easier all the way down towards town.  There are many intersections and ski run crossings, but they're all well marked.  The trail is partly shaded by aspens and fir.  

As you get near the bottom, Sweeney's Switchbacks becomes a dirt road with great views of the town of Park City.  There are several spur trails leading off Sweeney's Switchbacks at the bottom to provide access to various neighborhoods.  You'll come across several of the historic towers that carried mining ore down from the mountain.  Note:  bikes are allowed on this trail.

3.9,Point to Point,8668,6987,27,1708,8,27,Crescent Mine Grade (CMG),Intermediate,3.0,"        Crescent Mine Grade is a former mining road with an extremely consistent grade.  Start hiking on a skinny packed dirt path that contours around the hill crossing untold numbers of identical looking ski runs, ducking in and out of shady aspen groves.  

At the intersection with Mid Mountain Trail, hook a sharp right onto Mid Mountain Trail - this will be used to connect the two pieces of CMG.  You'll only stay on Mid Mountain Trail a short time until you reach a steep dirt road (Claim Jumper).  Instead of following Mid Mountain Trail straight across, descend the dirt road about 15 feet and pick up the signed Crescent Mine Grade on the right.  

Continue your journey across wildflower laden ski runs, down gentle grades with some slightly looser, rocky patches.  Take care at the junction of Jenni's Trail, this area can be congested with other users.  (Note:  the CMG trail is open for downhill biking only from Lower Jenni's Trail to the bottom.  Watch for the permissible uphill and downhill biking on CMG higher than Lower Jenni's Trail.)

The shrieks and yells you hear towards the bottom of CMG are not the hapless victims of sasquatch attacks - instead they come from the zip line/alpine slide/roller coaster circus at the base area.  Stop and watch if you're interested, the trail goes very close to the tracks in several places.

It has a remarkably smooth (non-rooty, non-rocky) trail surface with the only obstacles to avoid being scattered horse poop. This hiking/running and horse only trail is always within earshot of the surrounding bike trails, but at least you don't have to beware of descending bikers. 

Start the Hoof 'n' Boot Trail near where the Aqueduct Trail curves around a horse enclosure. The trail is well-signed as it initially intersects with bike trails. Don't be put off by a short steep section of eroded doubletrack road, this ends very soon. Pass a gate and duck back into the woods, following signs. The trail narrows and switchbacks through scrub oak and maple that turn pretty colors in fall. Cross over a dirt road, following signs towards a bridge on hiker's left. Pick up the Hoof 'n' Boot Trail again.  

As the trail climbs the hillside, the views improve. The switchbacks end for a time at viewpoint where you can see over Draper, the temple and far across the SLC valley. Continue to contour around the hill where the trail passes through a more open, grassy meadow. This pretty saddle area between the nearby hilltops affords the first views east towards the Ghost Falls area.  

After another series of wooded switchbacks, you cross more mountain bike trails and the Draper Alpine Road (Upper Corner Canyon Road). A new section of Hoof 'n' Boot continues uphill from here, with tight switchbacks through more scrub oak. The trail ends at a ""T"" intersection with the Peak View (Lower) Trail.

20.4,Point to Point,5858,4998,3084,3158,6,20,Behind the Reef Road,Intermediate,3.0,"        The Behind the Reef Road is a jeep road that is mostly fairly easy. It runs through magnificent desert scenery. And aside from its serious remoteness and some up and down, it's a non-threatening hike. Maybe that's what you are looking for.

The best reason to hike here, however, is not for the hiking. It's for the access it provides to incredible slot canyons slicing through the San Rafael Reef. 

The first canyons--down to and including Little Wild Horse and Bell--can more easily be accessed from the Goblin Valley side of the Reef.

So why not just drive out the Behind the Reef Road? Because while it is generally easy, there is a very difficult jeep section at Chute Canyon that prevents most vehicle access. This is a good place to park and start your hike, saving several miles and a lot of time, versus beginning at the start of the route where it leaves the Temple Mountain Road. 

So, this route is seemingly designed for slot canyon commuting! Hike as far as you like and then hike down one slot canyon, across the reef and up the next canyon, then retrace your route. Good canyons to pair are Crack/Chute, Little Wild Horse/Bell, and Ding/Dang. 

Little Wild Horse/Bell are the busiest of all the canyons, the easiest to access, perhaps the most scenic, and completely non-technical: you can take your (active) grandparents through these.

If you intend to go further out the road than this, you may want to camp at the start, and you'll still have to seriously beat feet to have enough daylight to finish before dark. The canyons also get more technical the further you go: there are some keeper potholes in some of these further slots, so don't do anything tricky unless you really know what you are about--people have died here.

To counter this trail's bevy of difficulties, it is very beautiful. With towering sandstone walls on both sides, massive cottonwood trees, and amazing geology, this trail is a treat for those that can handle the above paragraph.

5.0,Point to Point,6588,5615,975,2,4,17,Arch Canyon Trail (002),Intermediate,3.0,"        The Arch Canyon Trail travels along the bottom of a canyon next to and repeatedly through a perennial stream (plan on wet feet and bring appropriate footwear). This trail is infrequently maintained and can be difficult to follow. The grade is generally mellow but steepens progressively as you hike.

If you're not put off by the challenge of both reaching and traveling this canyon, you'll be rewarded with dramatic cliff faces towering over a forest of scattered ponderosa pines. There are also three arches to enjoy; Cathedral Arch is reached in the first quarter mile, Angel Arch in less than a mile, and Keystone Arch around the four mile mark. Lastly, you'll also pass the Butts Canyon Trail (465) at 1.4 miles.

Keystone Arch is a good turnaround spot if you're looking to shorten your journey or skip some elevation gain. Otherwise, keep going until you reach the end at a spill-off near the five mile mark.

This is a common area for moose sightings - don't get too close to a mother moose - they're mean and seriously dangerous!

The trail climbs a bit more steeply until you come to an intersection.  There may be a trail here indicating Shadow Lake Trail goes straight up a very steep, loose, and unappealing trail.  Instead go right on easier ground for 200 yards until you hit a dirt road.  Turn left and you'll end up at the same place: the major intersection of the Wasatch Crest Trail.

From the south, there's ample parking near the trailhead across from a corral. Follow the trail on a logging trace into a grove of aspen. Pretty soon the trail descends steeply into the bottom of Peavine Canyon. From here, the trail continues gently downward along and across a pleasant creek to end at the road near another corral.

Although not in wilderness to start, much of this trail travels through the Dark Canyon Wilderness.

1.8,Point to Point,4910,4534,380,276,7,21,Jumpoff Canyon Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        The Jump Off Canyon Trail starts out with a mild elevation climb and, after a couple of small switchbacks, you'll be presented with a choice. You can take this loop either clockwise or counter clockwise, and each option presents similar terrain. Both trails will meet up with the Bonneville Shoreline Trail and eventually end up in the mouth of Jump Off Canyon. 

The trail is fairly exposed to the sun, so if you're heading out this way, make sure that you bring adequate water and sun protection with you. No matter which direction you choose, there will be a moderate climb and descent, but the grades are gentle, and the trail is well maintained.

If the loop isn't long enough on its own, you can also follow the Jump Off Canyon Waterfall Trail to extend your outing to include a scenic waterfall.

1.4,Point to Point,8141,7767,88,442,7,20,Sultan Out and Back,Intermediate,3.0,"        The Deer Valley and Park City areas can feel overrun with mountain bikers, but the Sultan Out and Back Trail is designated a foot-traffic only trail, so you're likely to have a more pleasant experience.

The Sultan Out and Back Trail starts near the Silver Lake Village area and shares its beginning with the Nabob Loop. Head east from the top of the Silver Lake Express chairlift along the bottom of the McHenry ski run. You'll pass underneath the top of the Homestake ski lift to get to the start of the Nabob Loop Trail. Run along the McHenry ski run for a short distance before branching off to the right on what looks like a narrower ski run. Stay on this easy, alpine forest lined path until reaching the Nabob ski run.  Instead of turning north back into the forest (on the Nabob Loop) continue straight east across the Nabob ski run to cross under the Wasatch Express ski lift that you can see from here.  

The trail contours gently around the broad hillside through dense pine forest and then into a huge aspen grove (called the Triangle Trees area).  Descend steeply into a canyon and cross another series of ski runs before ducking under the Sultan Express chairlift.  The grade eases again for the remainder of the way down to the trail's end at a scenic deck with picnic tables.  Take in your fill of the views and then retrace your steps back up to the start for a 3 mile roundtrip hike.

The trail is shaded by aspen, scrub oak and spruce, making it a nice hike even in the hot weather. The trail has a gentle incline making it a fairly easy trip until around mile four. This is a nice place to stop, but if you are looking for a more difficult hike, there is a little trail that continues on and begins a steep climb that gets you very close to the summit. The trail suddenly ends at a fallen tree in about a half mile from Nelson Peak.

The trail follows a dry wash through some heavy vegetation for a short distance. When you emerge from the vegetation, the Little Purgatory Trail will be on your left. Continue straight as the Babylon Trail works its way uphill across varied terrain. At some points the trail is difficult to follow. Watch for cairns, some of which are small.

At about 2.5 miles, the trail reaches a barbed wire fence overlooking the town of Leeds. Make a sharp left and the trail will steadily climb, at times passing through the fence in several locations. After one long switchback, the trail ends and the Little Purgatory Trail begins.

2.6,Point to Point,9702,8872,830,0,6,15,Logan Peak Road FR042,Intermediate,3.0,"        From the Millville Peak Road FR 168, this newly constructed/renovated road goes up around the backside of Logan Peak to the top of the peak. It starts out in a pretty sparsely vegetated area but soon passes by small groves of trees and evergreen forests. The road has a couple of switchbacks in it as it reaches the peak, which makes the grade of the road very gradual. Although sections might get a little boring for hikers, it's a blast for hiking down and easily manageable on the way up. After winding around the back side of the peak, the road hooks around and reaches the peak where there is a large tower and a small building that has some weather instruments and other things associated with it. There is also an odd, mailbox looking thing at the top that has a summit log in it, but sometimes nothing to write with.

From the summit of Logan Peak, some of the greatest views in the Bear River Range can be found since it is pretty isolated from other tall peaks in the area. You can see down into Logan Canyon, a lot of the northern end of the Bear River Range, almost all of Cache Valley, and on clear days, even out into the Uintas and the Wasatch ranges. The winds up on Logan Peak are also very strong and make the stay at the top uncomfortable at times, but the views make it worth it. There is usually snow at the top late into the summer due to the cornices that form up on top from the wind and snow.

The trail starts on a wide, dirt road ascent as you leave Hidden Valley, and pretty soon reaches a junction with the Sawmill Trail. After that junction, the trail contours around to where it crosses the Big Willow Creek drainage, and from there the trail turns into a new section of singletrack (as of late 2017) that starts dropping down toward Rocky Mouth Canyon. Eventually, it hits a few short switchbacks and then drops in and meets up with the Rocky Mouth Falls Trail. From the junction, it is just a short jaunt up to the waterfall.

13.7,Point to Point,8886,4882,4496,1489,8,30,Millville Peak Road (FR 168),Difficult,3.0,"        Although this is a jeep road the entire way, it can still be a challenging and steep trail at times. It also gives access to many other trails, and can offer some amazing views of the southern Bear River range.

From the Millville Canyon Trailhead, the trail goes through the Deer Fence and starts to ascend gradually into the canyon. Before long, the creek can be seen from the trail and flows year round. The trail steepens in parts and in other parts it flattens out as it follows the creek through sprawling meadows. 

Although there are many spurs from this trail, at about 2.5 miles there is a junction with another jeep road off to the right (south) that goes up to an overlook of Blacksmith Fork Canyon (the South Fork Millville Canyon - FR 023 trail), which is a worthwhile destination. 

At about 3.25 miles or so, there is a big curve in the road where you can look back and get some great views of the Wellsvilles, and not long after that there is another spur trail (to the left/north this time) called the Big Baldy Trail that traverses under Big Baldy to get to Providence Canyon. After a little over 4 miles, the trail reaches an overlook where you can see down into Blacksmith Fork Canyon, Leatham Hollow, and the surrounding mountains and cliffs. The trail levels out at this point for a mile or so as it contours along the head of Leatham Hollow, and then starts to ascend again as it heads toward Millville Pass (the point over 8800 feet below Millville Peak).

From Millville Pass, the trail descends gradually through beautiful alpine forests of aspen and pines as the trail heads in the direction of Logan Peak. Some of the aspens along this route are massive and very tall, they are especially gorgeous in the fall when they are changing colors but are impressive year round. The trail doesn't drop very far before it reaches a large basin, and then starts to ascend again. 

After it starts to ascend again, it passes the fork in the trail where another jeep road heads off to Logan Peak and Providence Lake and continues on. The road ascends and descends gradually through some rolling hills until it reaches another set of forks - one that goes on to Inspiration Point and the North Syncline Trail, and then soon after that the Spring Hollow Trail. After the Spring Hollow Trail fork, the trail ascends to another pass, and then drops down some steep switchbacks to get to the White Bedground Camp, and meets up with the Adams Corral Road FR 052.

The pines morph to aspen groves, which give way to large meadows filled with flowers in late June through August. The La Sal Mountains are right in your face and are quite impressive.

Eventually, Clark Lake appears below to the right. Most people will take the right turn to do the Featured Hike Clark Lake Tour, but this trail continues for another mile and a half through more aspen forests before ending at Geyser Pass Rd, which is also accessible by car.

5.0,Point to Point,8271,7137,50,1180,5,22,Dark Canyon East Trail (006),Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail is sometimes referred to as ""The Notch Trail.""

From the top, reached via Dark Canyon Corridor (FR 378), the trail descends steeply for the first half mile. Near the bottom, you'll emerge onto a grassy valley floor with deep stream channels carving through the soil. From this point, the rest of the trail involves some navigating and scrambling as it crosses through channels and follows faint paths through the grass.

As you approach the first channel crossing, keep to the left side of the valley and look for a trail climbing out on the same side a little ways down. In a little bit you'll do the same thing again, but this time exit to the right. From here, the trail leads to the end of a long, grassy bluff before heading through the channel. Pick you way along this wide section as best you can. After less than a half mile, look for an exit to your right.

This channel-to-grass dance continues nearly till the end of the hike where the Scorup Cabin sits. This historic building was originally located in Rig Canyon but was relocated by J.A. Scorup for use by his cowhands from 1930 until the 1970s. If so inclined, enjoy a gentle look around the property.

When you're done, either head back the way you came or continue to Peavine Corridor Road (089) along the old road trace north of Scorup Cabin.

9.3,Point to Point,8499,6953,2071,525,5,31,West Rim Texas Canyon,Intermediate,3.0,"        While West Rim Texas Canyon is by no means a destination trail in itself, if you are in the area and looking for utter solitude and good views, and don't much care about the condition of the tread underfoot, then West Rim Texas Canyon is for you. 

The easiest starting point for this trail is off Arch Canyon Road at an easy-to-miss fork. Parking at the fork is the best choice for low-clearance vehicles, as the road ahead can be littered with medium-to-large ruts oriented in such a way that even staying high with your tires, you can inadvertently slip down in. For those with higher clearance, don't be discouraged. Even after some of the worst rain this area saw during the fall of 2016, this section of road was easily tackled by a stock Toyota Tacoma with bald all-season tires (or ""racing slicks"" as their owner affectionately called them). If you can make it up the road, simply park off to the side at the first fork you come to.

Starting at this point, follow the road to the left as it climbs steadily through rolling terrain, intermittently slogging up short but hellaciously steep grades clad with softball-sized loose rocks. After a few miles of this, the trail reaches a wooden hitching post and a brown wooden sign noting the trail direction. Follow the sign's instructions and climb yet another rutted, loose, ridiculously un-fun climb up a red dirt section of road. However, don't fear, as the climb is relatively short, and upon reaching the top, it rewards you with nice views of the surrounding area, including the swirling white sandstone of Texas Canyon.

At this point, the trail makes its way through a narrow bit of cliffside singletrack before descending steeply on the other side of the ridge through deciduous forest. From here, the white sandstone of Texas Canyon truly comes into view, directly before the trail takes a confusing right turn across a ravine to rejoin doubletrack on the other side.

Navigating more overgrown doubletrack, the trail continues up and over rolling terrain alongside Texas Canyon for the remainder of its length. Thankfully, it ends in a more established jeep track not far from Elk Mountain Road and just a short distance from the famed Bears Ears rock formations.

1.5,Point to Point,6569,5117,1452,0,18,35,George's Hollow Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail starts out somewhat gradually for a short section, but quickly starts to get steeper and rockier as the trail enters the drainage adjacent to George's Hollow. It then contours around the ridge and enters George's Hollow proper. 

At this point, the trail follows up the George's Hollow drainage, which is generally dry. About 0.75 mile in, there is a turnoff for the Living Room, which is a popular destination where people have taken rocks and organized makeshift furniture out of them. After passing the turnoff for the Living Room, the trail continues to ascend the George's Hollow drainage, and this section can get pretty narrow and rocky, but is a pretty fun, somewhat technical descent. 

The trail tops out at a saddle just below Red Butte, and from this saddle there are several options if you'd like to continue onto other trails and destinations (like Mount Wire), or you can return the way you came.

This is a road that is open to all motorized and non-motorized users. This route is not regularly maintained and is therefore extremely rough and often washed out. All motorized users of Peavine Corridor Road (089) need to be aware that the route heading towards the Scorup Cabin is washed out and impassable to vehicles approximately 1.5 miles from the cabin.

It follows an old road up Pole Canyon for about one mile, until the road becomes washed out. At this point, the trail follows near the bottom of the canyon on an extremely steep (15%) grade.

From this steep section, the trail continues, passing aspens and eventually hits the junction with Doe Canyon Trail.

The trail starts off steep and then drops down into the canyon and follows the creek for bit. Once it crosses Sheppard Creek you're committed to the north side where the trail is less traveled and begins to disappear. There are soda can tree markers that help with trail finding on the way up, but use caution as they are not visible on the return down and with the trail being rarely used it's possible to get off course. Use extreme caution when scrambling up the rocky section about half way up to the ridge, after that the trail markers continue to wind near the tree line following game trails or no trail at all. Eventually you'll make your way to gain elevation to the north ridge of the canyon.  Upon doing so, you easily connect up with the Wolverine trail. If you choose to do so, following Wolverine to the east will land you on the final ascent of dirt road to reach the Francis Peak Radar Towers.

Head down this trail until you get close to Upper Grant's Ranch. 

At this point you can return the way you came or if you don't mind hiking on some dirt roads you can make a loop by connecting Grant's Ranch Road to Pinto Road to get back to the trailhead where you started. The total loop distance is about 13.75 miles and is probably faster than returning the way you came since the road is a lot faster to hike.

The best guidance I can give is to look for the talus slope from the southwest side of Castle Peak and look for a ravine on the southern edge of that talus. You can also use the Hiking Project mobile app to help find your way.

The trail climbs up the southeast side of the ravine and is pretty easy to follow from there using cairns and ribbons tied in places along the trail. There is a pretty steep climb for the first quarter mile or so after leaving the Yellow Pine Trail, but then it levels out into a nice flat track that skirts the edge of Castle Peak all the way to Castle Lake.

Veering onto the Butts Canyon Trail (465) can make for a fun little diversion.

From the intersection with the Arch Canyon Trail (002), you'll soon leave the ponderosa pines behind as you travel up the canyon floor. This trail is infrequently maintained and quite faint. You'll spend a lot of time crossing over and hiking through the perennial stream. Make sure to bring appropriate footwear and plan on getting wet.

The trail continues for .8 miles beneath striped canyon walls to end at a 100-yard section of stream bed formed by slickrock.

5.5,Point to Point,9460,8455,1552,730,8,32,Aspen Flat Trail (018),Difficult,3.0,"        Aspen Flat can be accessed from the north or south. The southern trailhead is reached by driving a long ways up FR 079 from N. Creek Rd. (101). This option is probably more suitable for lower clearance vehicles. Higher clearance and 4x4 or AWD is recommended for the northern trailhead, but that's probably a nice point to start and do an out and back hike.

From the northern trailhead, you'll work your way pretty steeply uphill. The best advice is to just continue up the trail until it feels like you've gone far enough. Towards the southern end, it gets a bit less scenic, and even steeper in spots, so you may decide you've had enough. But the northern 2/3 of the trail provides excellent scenery, especially during fall aspen season.

Massive aspen groves are bisected by beautiful pastures with stellar views. The grade is very steep in places and the trail mostly follows the fall line - it can be loose, and sometimes a little chewed up. Also, given its remote and underused nature, expect to find your fair share of downed trees along this trail.

Head east from the top of the Silver Lake Express chairlift along the bottom of the McHenry ski run.  You'll pass underneath the top of the Homestake ski lift to get to the start of the Nabob Loop Trail.  Hike along the McHenry ski run for a short distance before branching off to the right on what looks like a narrower ski run.  Stay on this easy, alpine forest lined path until reaching the Nabob ski run.  Without crossing the ski run, the trail turns sharply northwards back into the pretty forest and begins a series of downhill switchbacks.  When the switchbacks end and the trail begins ascending, you have the option of a.) emerging back onto McHenrys ski run and using it to return westwards (left) to end the loop at the Silver Lake Village area  OR b.) continuing through the trees westwards on the Nabob Loop trail.  The later option is more shaded and passes through a couple of tiny clearings before rejoining the McHenry ski run.  Note: bikes are not allowed on the Nabob Trail. 

Fun factoid:  the definition of ""nabob"" is a wealthy person, so this trail's name fits with the theme of the other trails on this mountain!

Starting from its westernmost end at the junction with Aspen Flat Trail (018), the trail descends gradually through a patchwork of trees and grass, periodically offering visitors great views of Twin Peaks. After a brief rockier section, the trail descends steeply for a third of a mile to its low point at a crossing of Indian Creek.

If the creek has backflowed into a muddy bog, there's a user-built bypass that should provide a reasonable way across. 

After crossing the creek, the climbing resumes. While gradual at first, it quickly becomes steeper, navigating a pair of switchbacks before rising steadily along the contours of the slope. Upon reaching a craggy corner, the Red Ledges Access Trail (160) makes an appearance to the right, whereafter the trail continues with more rocky climbing. Eventually, the grade lessens as a section of rolling terrain begins.

Along this section, the trail's narrow singletrack continues to leapfrog from trees to meadows to create a beautiful alpine feel. As the trail crosses a low ridgeline, it begins a gradual, half-mile descent over one of its prettiest sections. Enjoy the open views, sunny meadows, and bright forests. 

A small creek crossing signals the final, sustained climb to the intersection with the Robertson Pasture Trail. Near the top, the tread becomes more rough and rutted.

There are great views of the La Sals, Monitor and Merrimac mesas, and Arches National Park off in the distance.

Pass through various washes and alternate between old jeep roads and sections of singletrack. There are lots of intersections, so pay attention to the blue paint marks, the signs, and use the Hiking Project mobile app to keep on the right trail.

The trail finishes at the road near the second hairpin turn but there's no sign and it's a little tricky to find. Look for the big swathe of slickrock and a few cairns.

The first few miles are spent doggedly paralleling North Cottonwood Creek as the road cuts through several drainages and washes. A road trace just before a lone building marks the intersection with the Hop Creek Trail (022).

As the trail continues, the surrounding canyons slowly become less arid as more green fades in. Ahead, two steep switchbacks and a rocky drainage-crossing precede the intersection with the steep Reservoir Canyon Trail (008). From here, the trail narrows into singletrack.

A bit further on, the face of an eroding bluff has deposited boulders near a large confluence. The trail heads right around the bluff to follow the banks of Vega Creek. Over the next few miles, the singletrack continues to gently wind up the canyon to a nice grove of ponderosa pine.

The trees offer some welcome shade and signal a slightly steeper section ahead. After rounding this bluff, the trail closely follows a steam-bed through thick vegetation. This section continues for about 1.5 miles until the trees recede into a three-way intersection.

6.7,Point to Point,8490,7605,1991,1581,10,46,Tuerto Trail (011),Difficult,3.0,"        The Tuerto Trail (011) doesn't have über-convenient parking near either of its ends. Most commonly attempted from south to north, most people leave a shuttle vehicle at the Aspen Flat Trail (018) Parking Area - North and drive south to park their second car at the Skyline Trail (015) Pull-Off Parking Area.

The Tuerto Trail (011) intersects many other trails, making it a strong contender for a self-made loop. Starting from the south, look for a worn trail leading down from FS Road 095 to the gully below. Cross over the Trough Canyon Trail (163) to the other side and follow the dusty trail that climbs above the nearby slope's exposed rock. From here, the clearly defined singletrack contours a ridge while providing pleasant views of the surrounding area.

At a mile-and-a-half, the opposite end of the Trough Canyon Trail (163) connects back to the Tuerto Trail (011) in a wooded section just below a saddle. At the saddle, turn to the right to soon connect with the Tuerto to Skyline Trail (457) before traveling along a ridgeline that ends with a steep descent along tightly spaced switchbacks into a gully.

On the other side of the gully, the trail climbs up another prominent white-rock ridge. Just before you begin to descend the other side, the start of the Blue Creek-Tuerto Trail (014) appears to your right. From the bottom, the trail continues on a pleasant, rolling descent for nearly two miles. Along this section, the beginning of the Blue Creek / Allen Canyon Trail (013) appears just before the Tuerto Trail (011) descends into a final gully.

The remainder of the trail is a long, straight grind to the shelf high above. If you are hiking this as an out-and-back and want a milder place to turn around, this is a fine place to do so. Otherwise, descend into the gully and start climbing.

After a brief scramble onto the ridge, the trail heads seemingly straight up. The grade is steep and constant, and the terrain is quite rocky in spots. Needless to say, these factors will leave you with a strong feeling of accomplishment upon reaching the top of the mesa. 

Once you've reached the trail's end, either return the way you came or head north to the Aspen Flat Trail (018) Parking Area - North to reach your shuttle vehicle.

It also makes for a nice loop by using the southern portion of the Tuerto Trail (011). The most accessible parking nearby can be found at the pull-off across from the Skyline Trail (015).

The Trough Canyon Trail starts off of the Tuerto Trail in the gully just below FS Road 095. From here, it gradually descends through the canyon beneath a series of prominent finned ridges. The stream bed that runs nearby supports a rich collection of vegetation that bolsters the canyon's appeal.

At the one-mile mark, the trail turns to the right to follow a side stream along a winding canyon. The grade steepens from this point, mildly at first, but then steeply over the final push at the top of the canyon. There, the trail intersects with the Tuerto Trail (011), which makes for a nice return trip if you take a right.

From the quarry, there are several jeep roads that head east, it doesn't matter which one you take - they all converge pretty quickly into the main trail that leads up to the head of the canyon. The first mile or so of this trail is covered in steep, loose rock which can be hard to hike on at times, but the tread improves as it gets higher up. The trail quickly leaves the rocky, barren nature of the quarry area and enters a forest of aspens and other beautiful trees. The trail breaks into several meadows as well, as it ascends, and finally once the climbing is over the trail enters a large meadow of sagebrush and grasses where you can often see cows grazing, or deer if you're lucky. 

At the top of this trail, there are some great views of Millville Peak, some sections of Cache Valley, as well as Logan and Providence peaks and the wide surrounding meadows and forests.

1.1,Point to Point,5838,5716,184,62,4,20,Skintoe Trail,Easy,3.0,"        Starting at the small parking area just before the sign for Camp Kiesel, this trail crosses the reservoir over a small dam and spillway. The trail then turns to the right and follows a line that very closely parallels the edge of the reservoir, although it is probably about 15-20 feet above the water level. In some places the trail can feel narrow and looks like you could jump all the way into the reservoir because the ground slopes off into the reservoir so steeply, but it is in general safe and a great way to get some great views of the reservoir. 

About 2/3 of the way in, an old jeep trail splits off of this trail and goes up the hillside toward Baldy Ridge. As you pass this fork, the trail starts to get a little bit more rocky, until it eventually reaches a large pile of fallen rock, which is where the trail effectively ends. Several game trails and faint, poorly maintained trails branch off of this trail and head in various directions (including in the direction that NeoTreks shows), but these trails are hard to follow and very hard to hike on, so this trail effectively ends as shown on the accompanying map, above a very popular cliff jumping spot.

This twisting descent through the aspen glade is arguably the best part of the trail. Continue downhill through scrubby meadows and revel in the fall colors if you're lucky enough to time your visit just right.  There are periodic views of nearby South Peak to the west. About 1/3 of the way along the Wagonwheel Trail, you arrive at a junction with the Wagonwheel to Fr 0087 spur. Continue on Wagonwheel - straight and downhill to the southwest. 

Begin a gentle climb through a more open area that can become quite boggy after a heavy rain. After a brief traverse along a bench with sweeping eastward views, the trail gradient steepens and soon reaches Verdure Creek. Head up another short incline to reach the start of the West Wagon Road Loop Trail. Continue south on the Wagonwheel Trail passing through thickets teeming with nonchalant deer. The last part of the trail threads through a piney plateau with hardly any other ground vegetation. The trail ends at a junction of FR0084 and FR0085 (near the pit toilet).

Fall colors are pretty here, but be sure to wear orange during hunting season as this area is popular with motorized hunting parties.

4.1,Point to Point,9224,7945,1279,466,8,28,Camp Jackson Trail #016,Intermediate,3.0,"        Camp Jackson Trail is a pleasant hike through a variety of terrain. There are a few steep and rocky sections, but the views along the ridge make it well worth the effort.

The trail starts off of a well-maintained dirt road (0084) - you can park at a small trailhead about a half mile up the road that has a trail map and pit toilet. Keep an eye open for the trailhead which is marked with a large wooden sign. 

The trail initially descends a doubletrack through a pine and oak forest, coming to a small meadow on the right-hand side. I saw a flock of wild turkeys here and several deer. After this brief downhill, the trails starts what will be a long and steady climb. As you hike through the trees on the lower portion of the climb, be sure to glance to your right to see a series of interesting bluffs and rock formations, and to your left to see some views down the canyon.

At about 1.5 miles, you'll hit the steepest part of the climb - it is a lung and leg burner straight up a ridgeline, but don't despair, as every bit of elevation you gain will reward you with increasingly impressive views of South Peak to the east and open vistas down to Bear Ears to the southwest. This slope is very rocky and the soil underneath the rocks is slippery clay, so watch your footing if there has been any recent rain.

From the top of this ridge, the climb mellows out, and the trail starts to wind through scrub oak tunnels and small groves of aspen. Be warned that local ranchers use this land to graze their cattle. I startled several cows in a section of thick scrub oak, and I am not sure who had a bigger heart attack, me or the cows.

After all the climbing, you are in for a treat at the end of your hike as the trail takes a sudden plunge into a beautiful grove of large aspens that are especially gorgeous in the fall. Enjoy this last half mile down through the aspens, before the trail pops out on another dirt road where you can choose to continue your hike or return the way you came.

2.5,Point to Point,9391,8774,527,721,9,34,Boren Mesa Trail #037,Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail provides a connection between Geyser Pass Rd and the Lake Oowah Campground (both accessible by passenger cars).

This is mostly used to complete the Clark Lake Tour Featured Hike, but it's reasonably pleasant on its own. Aspen forests, meadows, wildflowers, and a few steep (but short) hills make this a decent escape from the Moab summer heat.

2.7,Point to Point,8226,7075,239,1153,10,47,Mud Springs #173,Difficult,3.0,"        Mud Spring #173 starts from the Ridge Trail #157 and descends north towards Mill Canyon #40, passing Tibble Fork along the way.

The trail begins with a short climb that transitions through a wide meadow to a steep and rugged downhill to the intersection with Tibble Fork. There are plenty of rocks and roots.

Stay straight at the intersection to finish the bottom part of the route. The grade is easy going at first and the plunges past pockets of meadows to the intersection with Mill Canyon #40. A left turn continues downhill while a right turn climbs back up steeply to the Ridge Trail #157.

0.8,Point to Point,5596,5265,331,0,8,16,Behind-the-Rocks 191 Connector,Intermediate,3.0,"        When this extreme jeep trail is snow-covered it means only a handful of hikers will be out enjoying the area. The trail climbs steadily with one very steep but short scramble. The grand views of the La Sal mountains are behind you, so stop now and then to have a look. 

The road is a mixture of sand and sandstone so even exposed wet sections are not slimy mud. The exposed sandstone is marked with black rubber where jeepers have left part of their tread behind. Be sure to leave the gate closed as the area is actively used for cattle grazing. The trail ends at a T-intersection with the better known  Behind the Rocks Road. A delightful hike for views but don't expect quiet as the sounds of Hwy 191 follow you up the road.

Road 193 Singletrack Connector (a short, steep singletrack trail) and heads straight up toward American Fork Twin Peaks. The road gets pretty steep in places, and can be rocky, but does have one short section of downhill through a meadow of bluebells (which is an awesome, albeit short section). 

The trail then starts to ascend again and then starts to head northwest until it ends/transitions into an unmaintained singletrack trail (the American Fork Twin Peaks Trail) that goes to the top of American Fork Twin Peaks. This trail also has some great views of Mount Timpanogos throughout and the surrounding canyons, since there is little to no shade or forest along the trail to block views.

2.6,Point to Point,7200,6211,1132,292,10,25,South Fork Millville Canyon - FR 023,Intermediate,3.0,"        From where the trail splits off of the main Millville Canyon road, the road immediately starts ascending through a forest that alternates between dense and sparsely populated with aspens, conifers and scrub oak, along with various other plants. The road was built basically in the bottom of a drainage, so it gets quite eroded in parts, leaving deep ruts. 

The road curves up and around as it ascends through forests and meadows. After a little over a mile, it starts to level out a little bit and the ascent becomes less steep over the next half mile. 

At this point, the trail reaches its apex, which also happens to be pretty devoid of trees Lack of tree coverage makes for great views of the surrounding, higher cliffs and mountains. 

From this point, the trail descends gradually through sagebrush meadows and aspen forests until at last, the final ascent comes and the trail goes up steeply until it reaches an end, where a small trail goes out from the road onto an exposed hillside where you can get great views of Blacksmith Fork canyon from almost 2000' above.

This trail mostly stays in short maple forests, which means it has plenty of shade most of the way, and is also on the north-facing side of the Traverse Mountains, which generally makes it one of the better trails for afternoon hikes in the summer. 

The trail has a few long switchbacks on the descent toward Ann's Trail, and almost parallels it at times, but eventually comes out after a little over a mile right onto Ann's Trail. This can be a great trail for some nice fall colors if the conditions have been right during the fall.

1.3,Point to Point,5211,5138,81,49,2,6,Practice Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        The Gooseberry Mesa trail network sits at 5200 feet elevation on a slickrock mesa. The trail is marked with white paint dots on the slickrock and signs at the junctions. The network is a bit of a maze, but fairly easy to follow. The trail undulates up and down house size sandstone mounds and twists through tight rock canyons. It's the perfect technical trail. There are many ways to connect the various trails to make it longer or shorter, harder or easier, and they're all good. If this is your first time, you may want to try out the Practice Trail first to get your Gooseberry groove on. Bring lots of water. There is no drinking water available on the mesa. There is primitive camping available in the area. 

I mapped this trail counter-clockwise because many people take this trail first as a warm up.  The trail starts by branching off the doubletrack (north) about 0.3 miles west of the White Trailhead.  It ends back on the two track road.  From here you can loop back to the trailhead on the road or continue onto one of the other trails.  Do not be fooled by the name.  Slickrock virgins will find this trail challenging, and Gooseberry veterans still enjoy this trail.

It passes by a small centennial celebratory marker made of granite. As the trail wraps around past the Dimple Dell Road parking lot, it drops through a small drainage and then passes by a large outdoor amphitheater. The surface is pretty well maintained, and changes from sandy trail to hard-packed dirt road through a few sections. This is a great trail to add into a short outing or as a part of a tour of longer Dimple Dell trails.

2.1,Point to Point,4612,4462,167,23,2,4,Margarita,Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail starts out on a mesa just above Dalton Wash, and immediately sets out on some slickrock where the route is mostly delineated by cairns and baskets full of rocks. These markers are pretty frequently placed, so it isn't too hard to stick to the route, and if you can't see a cairn, there are usually mountain bike tracks in the little dirt portions between the slickrock sections. 

At around 1 mile into the trail, the trail gets close enough to the edge of the mesa to allow great views into Dalton Wash, which can be really green and lush in the spring. This section, up until about 1.3 miles in is in a sparse forest of short shrubs and trees, but then the trail opens up and you start to get some amazing views of Cougar Mountain and some of the surrounding peaks to the northeast. 

The trail continues in the open (it can get pretty hot and exposed during the summer) like this until it connects with the Guacamole Trail.

1.8,Point to Point,6161,5659,503,25,6,15,Maple Hollow South Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        Starting from the South Maple Hollow Trailhead, this singletrack trail ascends through scrub maple and scrub oak, roughly paralleling the South Maple Hollow drainage on the east side of the drainage. This trail is generally south and west facing, so snow doesn't usually stick around too long on the lower part of the trail. 

Although the route is mostly smooth, there are a few rocky sections, but things are generally pretty easy and not very technical. As the trail gets closer to its end, it crosses a drainage where a small creek generally flows, and then after a couple of switchbacks the trail switches over to the west side of the drainage, where things generally hold more snow into later in the spring. The trail finishes up by going through a large culvert under Deer Ridge Drive, and after about another hundred yards ends at the Maple Hollow Trailhead Park. 

The great thing about this trail isn't necessarily the trail itself, or even the scenery (although both are pretty decent), but the possibilities it opens up for loops and long hikes in the area. It connects to the Eagle Crest Trail and Maple Hollow North Trail up above, the Woodshollow Trail down below, and even basically connects with Deer Ridge Drive, which can be used to access other portions of Suncrest.

1.2,Point to Point,5424,5116,323,17,5,11,Rattler,Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail starts by splitting off of the BST: Draper Section pretty soon after leaving the East Bench Trail, just off of the Corner Canyon Road. After leaving the BST, this trail starts to weave in and out of small drainages, through sagebrush and sparse vegetation, which makes it feel high above the surrounding trails and Corner Canyon below. 

The first quarter mile is relatively flat, and after that the trail starts to climb gradually. A little bit more than 0.5 miles into the trail, there is a section that is pretty rocky, where the trail has been built with talus, which makes it a fun section of the trail. The trail then turns back into dirt, and continues to climb, somewhat paralleling the Corner Canyon Road. After 1.2 miles, the trail meets up with the Ghost Falls Trail, which leads to Ghost Falls, just a short distance from the end of the Rattler trail.

3.0,Point to Point,9956,8316,1831,190,13,80,Blue Creek-Tuerto Trail (014),Intermediate/Difficult,3.0,"        Starting from the Tuerto Trail (011), the Blue Creek-Tuerto Trail (014) immediately begins a series of steep switchbacks. The steep grade levels off pretty quickly once hikers have made their way onto the rock shelf that sits on top of the ridgeline. From this vantage, the views extend in every direction and the distant red rock behind you contrasts nicely with the green and white that colors nearer slopes.

As the trail enters a small, sandy depression, clumps of thick, low bushes crowd the way. The trail can be difficult to follow, but it stays generally left at first, before cutting to the right toward a protrusion from the shelf. The exposure here isn't significant, but it gives a nice sense of traveling near the edge.

Near the end of the shelf, the trail is once again clearly defined. From here, it climbs to the left through an aspen grove and then descends through a lovely grassy meadow. Just past the trees on the other side, the trail briefly overlaps with the Blue Creek / Allen Canyon Trail (013) before diverging to the right past two old buildings.

Up ahead, Blue Creek makes an appearance before several steep switchbacks that ascend through a thick aspen forest. The climbing remains steady, but the scenery changes as rocky clearings and grassy meadows are passed on the way to the top. This long climb ends at the intersection with the Shay Ridge Trail (162).

Use this trail to get to a great viewpoint on the edge of the cliff, looking out towards Arches National Park. 

Warning: Continuing along the Gold Bar Rim and Portal route requires big commitment, and more experience.

1.1,Point to Point,6712,5954,758,211,16,28,South Hooper Ridge Trail Connector,Intermediate,3.0,"        This is a trail that has been reclaimed by the Forest Service from a man who was mis-managing his private property. Specifically, he was falsely marking this trail as being within his private property boundaries. After setting the mountain-side on fire a few years ago, the Forest Service found out about this, and made him re-mark his property boundaries. 

Anyhow, this trail drops off the South Hooper Ridge Trail along the gas-pipeline to the canyon bottom, then follows it up to where it re-meets the ridge trail further up. Enjoy this shady alternative. It is best done in this direction to avoid a need to ascend the steep section of the gas-pipeline.

Stay out of private property. You'll see signs that clearly mark the boundaries.

It's a new trail as of summer 2013 and it's obvious some thought went into keeping it a fun, smooth, trail along the bottom contour of a bluff. The trail is mostly buffed out dirt with a patch or two of slick rock and/or sand so beware of mud and rutted areas after a storm.

In a few hundred yards, turn right to start onto the Lazy/EZ singletrack.  Stay right on EZ when the Lazy joins in from the left. From there, the hike winds along the base of the ridge, with just enough rocks and tight turns to keep it fun. 

After a little over a mile, the trail makes a hard right and goes up a short climb to join up with the Bar-M Loop. Stay right and look for the Bar-B trail marker. 

As you descend this trail gets harder and harder as it drops to the junction with Killer B.  If Difficult trails are not your thing, you can skip Killer B and loop back around to Lazy/EZ on an easy doubletrack. 

This loop can be used in either direction.

0.7,Loop,5837,5806,35,36,2,7,Wrangler,Easy,3.0,"        Wrangler and Rowdy are loop trails adjacent to and accessed through the Horsethief Campground. These are designed primarily with kids in mind however they offer a great, albeit small, taste of what hiking in the greater Moab area is like for any novice or anyone here for the first time. 

Featuring a bit of slickrock, a little sand, twisty corners and some step up/downs from small rock ledges they are a preview of what one will find throughout the rest of Moab on a much larger and challenging scale. 

If you are not staying in the campground, please park outside the gate near the dumpster area, or contact the Host and ask permission to park within the campground. Both trails start at a map kiosk marked ‘Camp Trails’ on the Buckskin Loop of the campground.

Wrangler is the easiest of the two trails as it wanders an almost mile long twisting route all within the fenced area of the campground. Some small ups and downs and various little obstacles keep the attention focused and speed limited. This is a great area for kids to spot squirrels, rabbits and lizards as well.

The route starts by dropping in from Ridge Trail #157 and then mellows out into a nice traverse. Through here, you'll be hiking through aspens and open meadows with nice views of the surrounding peaks.

As the trail rounds a ridge, it starts a steady downhill to Holman Trail #039. From here, you'll have two options, both steep and rugged descents. Continue on Holman Trail #039 for a short section and then stay left on Holman Ridge - Cabin Flat #172 to access Mill Canyon #40.

Stay on Holman Trail #039 for a rugged and rough adventure to FR 085.

There's a little rolling terrain as Inside Passage follows the contours of the slope, but a few spots of well-laid rock work make for easy going. Hikers may catch a refreshing breeze at the top of the next rise before the trail curves down to pass between two huge boulders on the way to join the Klondike Bluff 4x4.

In the spring, a few varieties of wildflower bloom along the trail and add small drops of color to the surrounding rocks, dirt, and sagebrush.

The trail itself is relatively flat and easy, so you get a bit of recovery time. Watch for jeep traffic when crossing Gemini Bridges Road. 

Some common ways of using this connector would be to descend the upper half of Bull Run and return by Getaway. You could also descend Getaway from the west, or climb up it from Arth's Corner from the east to use this connector to access the bottom portion of Bull Run.

From the top, descend down a wide, slightly sandy wash.  It's much smoother than neighboring trails here.  There's no slickrock, and it's not painted here.  After threading through a shallow canyon, keep an eye out for the UFO trail on the left - it's easy to bomb right past it.

From here, you'll be able to hike more slickrock, following the gold dashes down bumpy terrain, passing EKG, then Dino-Flow, and finally out to Copper Ridge 4x4.

3.0,Point to Point,10907,9812,15,1110,7,20,Vista Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        The trail starts at the top of the Giant Steps Express Lift.  Stepping off the lift, the trail starts to the right. Initially the trail co-exists with the Color Flow bike trail, but the two soon split. Beyond this point, there are no bikes allowed on the Vista Trail and no hikers allowed on the Color Flow Trail.

The trail meanders down the mountain, following a similar path as the Color Flow Trail, crossing it a few times, but generally out of sight. The frisbee-golf course also follows a nearby route. The trail is generally well signed when needed as it intersects numerous service roads and bike trails.

Towards the bottom, the trail closely parallels the Color Flow and Timberline trails (within sight of each other).  Near the end, the trail just kind of fades away. The last sign pointed a vague direction towards the lodge, but the trail seemed to disappear.  No worries, the lodge is easily reached cross-country down the hill.

The trail could also be hike uphill for added exercise, but the trail signs seem to be pointed for downhill traffic.

It starts at the campground loop and heads south towards Little Ruin Canyon. Just 100 yards in, it may appear as if the trail ends, but it actually drops down into a very narrow fissure in the rock before emerging into the canyon just a few dozen yards later. The trail is obvious to follow from here. Within Little Ruin Canyon, the trail initially stays on the northern side, but after half a mile drops into the canyon wash. Follow the dry bed another half mile until you reach the junction with Keeley Canyon. Turn left here, following the wash for 100 yards before heading up the eastern side onto the elevated grassy slope. From here on, the trail heads north, occasionally passing a dry creek bed until about 3 miles in when the trail goes up the western side of the canyon, right on the border to Colorado. The trail levels again just a fifth of a mile later and reaches the Holly ruins at 3.4 miles. The first notable sight is Holly House right at the canyon rim. The trail turns left, circling the canyon head and passing Tilted Tower before reaching a small parking lot at the end of a dirt road.

1.3,Point to Point,9698,9121,577,0,9,14,Navajo Trail #32054,Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail departs from the Navajo Lake Campground and takes switchbacks through a forested drainage to the top of the ridge. This ridge is part of the Virgin River Rim, or the boundary of the watershed that forms the Virgin River in Zion National Park. From the top of this trail you can find an overlook with a distant view of the national park. Look for the pointy sandstone mesas that form Zion's magnificent skyline.

Hike this trail as an out and back on its own, or combine it with the Virgin River Rim trail and the Navajo Lake Loop trail to make a roundtrip loop of about 6 miles from the campground.

2.8,Point to Point,5957,4952,1005,0,7,19,BST: Grandeur Peak Trailhead to Pipeline Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        New as of 2023, this is the long-awaited connector to link the Bonneville Shoreline Trail from Pipeline to Grandeur Peak Trail. Together with the short paved section over the freeway, this connector completes the BST between Parleys Canyon and Millcreek Canyon.

While hiking this somewhat steep trail you'll get expanding views over the city of Millcreek and eventually the lake. Use the trail to reach the viewpoint at the west end of Pipeline Trail or continue farther along the Bonneville Shoreline Trail in either direction.

Huge thanks to Salt Lake County, city of Millcreek, Bonneville Shoreline Trail Committee, and Utah Trails for making this trail a reality by purchasing private holdings after years of negotiations.

0.6,Point to Point,6799,5922,877,0,29,41,Cave Peak Trail,Difficult,2.8,"        This trail takes you to Cave Peak, but I believe it is more commonly referred to as Pyramid Peak. The trail goes up a steep section of the gas pipeline that is sometimes skied in winter. The trail starts about a mile and a half up the Mueller Park Trail.

Note that there are several descents from Cave Peak, such as one leading into North Canyon, but all of them (except for the one you came up) lead to private property or private roads that have been recently closed due to vandalism. It's quite unfortunate. 

This trail, as far as I'm aware, is the last possible way to the peak that avoids private property. Of course, until the peak itself is claimed by a private land owner (it would not surprise me); there will probably always be a way you could bushwhack to the peak. If it was completely surrounding by private property, but not claimed as such, then I guess you'd have to parachute in. Better to take a chopper so you could get out. If, however, the air-space gets privatized, you're out of luck until mankind invents molecular transport.

From the peak, there is a trail heading east along the ridge-line towards Rudy's Flat, but it turns into a bushwhack pretty quick.

There is plenty of glissading you can do.  I recommend an ice-axe for the final section of the trail before Francis Peak.  Believe me, hiking it without an ice-axe is no fun.

3.2,Point to Point,8217,6926,1290,0,8,20,Spiro Trail,Intermediate,2.5,"        The Spiro Trail is one of the most popular ways to get from town into the hills.  To reach the start of Spiro, either take the Silver Spur trail from the ski area base or head through the golf course neighborhood to where the trail hits Crescent Road.  

This multi-use trail gets a lot of downhill mountain bike traffic in the summer, so if you're trying to avoid other users, hike early or late in the day.  The trail itself is a lovely trek at a consistent grade uphill through aspens and clumps of wildflowers.  The numerous early switchbacks provide views galore.  You'll cross so many ski runs, and part of the navigational enjoyment is to orient yourself to where you ski in the winter months.

1.3,Point to Point,5491,5422,15,76,1,3,Visitor Center Trail,Easy,2.5,"        The path between the picnic area and the visitor center really doesn’t fit the usual or official definition of a trail, but it is a nice route and a good introduction to the geologic and human history of Fruita. The path is especially suited for those who arrive early at the campground and need both a little exercise after pulling in and some information about Capitol Reef. It is also the only trail in the park where dogs are allowed, so Rex and Fluffy will like it too. 

Campers can access the Visitor Center Trail by picking up the east end of the Fremont River Trail that borders Loops A and B on the north side next to the river and heading downstream (east) past the Gifford House to the bridge on the Scenic Drive. Others should park at the picnic area, which is 1.0 mile from the visitor center on the Scenic Drive. The path is located just across the Scenic Drive to the west.

Wherever you choose to start, the trail meanders across streams and beside historic orchards rich with heirloom apple varieties, among other fruit, to eventually end in the Capitol Reef Visitor Center Parking Area.

As you look west from this point, there is a large gap in the land that rises before you. Stay to the right side of this gap and follow the gravel road up toward a water tank and parking lot.  Climb to the parking lot (high clearance vehicles can drive to the lot), continue on to the fence at the top of the climb.  

The trail starts with an short easy climb but is soon followed by a nice downhill. There are signed easy and difficult routes to get you down the Acid Drops (this is primarily directed at the bikers on route). Once you are at the bottom of the Acid Drops turn left and continue down. 

Be aware that mountain bikers tend to ride this trail quickly. Be alert and aware of other trail users.

The road is very well maintained and pretty obvious and easy to follow. The road ascends gradually and is pretty manageable on the way up, and although there are loose rocks and some erosional features, it is mostly a well maintained road through a beautiful forest. 

After about 0.75 miles, there is a split for the Deer Creek-Dry Creek Trail #043 off to the left, which is a great trail to access Box Elder Peak. After approximately 2.5 miles, Silver Lake Flat finally comes into view, which can be really beautiful depending on the water level. 

A little after 3 miles, the road passes by a parking lot for the Silver Lake Trail and soon thereafter crosses a (sometimes sizeable) creek. The creek can usually be easily crossed on a series of rocks if you don't want your feet to get wet. After crossing the creek, the road continues up past a series of small camping areas in a clearing near the creek, and then eventually ""ends"" by transitioning into a pair of other forest service roads, one going up toward American Fork Twin Peaks and the other heads off to the west towards a couple of other places.

Depending on the season, this trail may be very difficult. The thicket, especially in the lower parts of the canyon, can be impenetrable. As an alternative, you may want to climb up the side of the canyon, but it is not easy to find a path there either. Only shortly before you reach Lamanite Arch, you'll actually get a good view.

Both of the southern areas are reached by driving a long ways up FS Rd 079. Most vehicles will park near the start of FS Rd 0354, leaving hikers to travel 1.5 miles up the rough road. If you have a capable 4WD vehicle you may be able to drive FS Rd 0354 to the trailhead. The northern parking area is adjacent to the Aspen Flat Trail (018) and is suitable for higher clearance AWD and 4x4 vehicles.

Starting from the top, remember to sign in at the kiosk at the trailhead. After that, you'll be on the main Shay Ridge Trail, a signed OHV trail - not open to vehicles larger than a Razor ATV. Follow the tire treads as they climb along a grassy knoll through swaths of forest. The view of the Abajos to the east (right) is quite rewarding - just make sure to also keep an eye on your footing as you navigate the baseball-sized rocks that litter the trail.

At the top of the climb, make a fairly sharp left below a bald knob. Look for a clearing and picnic table on the left where you can hang out for a bit before starting your descent. From here the trail descends steadily for several miles.

Continuing on, you'll follow similar tire tracks down through aspens, It's quite beautiful when the leaves are changing. Roughly halfway through the descent is the intersection with the Blue Creek-Tuerto Trail (014). From here, the trail leads through one last dense grove of aspen before completing its final miles through low vegetation. The tread is increasingly rocky until it goes through a loose sandy section.

The trail crosses through meadows and forests, and across a dry creek bed (it was dry in the fall when I went; maybe it has water in the spring). 

After ascending for a few hundred vertical feet, the trail drops down into the White Pine Creek drainage and crosses the creek, and then starts to ascend again toward the headwaters to the west. This part has some beautiful views of White Pine Creek and follows it closely enough to hear the rushing waters for most of the rest of the trail.

Scrambling/climbing up past the waterfall isn't terribly difficult, and neither is getting down that section. Just be careful you don't generate rock-fall for those camped out at the base of the waterfall.

Once past the scrambling section, you'll find a trail that quickly becomes difficult to follow. Just follow the creek as it bends southwest. Before the creek bends west, leave it and hike straight up the slope, bushwacking off-trail through dense brush and scrambling across scree.

Once up above the rock ledges, look around, and you'll find a trail that takes you to the cabin. Consider coming down the well-worn trail that follows the north ridge of Adam's Canyon. Or you could continue on up to Thurston Peak, then come down the south ridge of Adam's Canyon where there is another well-stocked cabin along the way.

Note that Adam did not build the cabin, so I don't refer to it as ""Adam's Cabin."" Also, I believe that users of the cabin are expected to replace what food they eat with food they bring. Don't bother reading the cabin log. There's a lot of innuendo in there.

The road winds up through some forests and crosses a creek, and in many places is very rocky with large boulders in the road. 

The road levels out somewhat and passes a junction with the Shorty's Cutoff Trail, and the creek comes back into view. The road more or less follows the creek for most of its existence as it then heads toward Doubletop Mountain, which is one of the most spectacular peaks in the Bear River Range. In certain places you can catch a glimpse of this peak from the road if you get a break in the trees. 

Eventually, the road ends at another parking area (that you can really only get to with a pretty high clearance vehicle, as the road is in pretty bad shape down closer to the Franklin Basin Road) where the road then turns into a small trail that leads to a small basin just below Doubletop Mountain. This road is more of a means to an end rather than an amazing trail in and of itself, but it does offer some views of some pretty amazing country in the Bear River Range and has great opportunities to see wildlife if you go at the right time.

7.5,Point to Point,10438,7753,1980,2685,12,45,Blue Creek-Allen Canyon Trail (013),Difficult,2.0,"        The Blue Creek-Allen Canyon Trail (013) is accessed at its southern end by FS Road 095 and ends in a junction with the Tuerto Trail (011). The trail is on the longer side for the area, but its difficult nature and stretches of indistinct routing suggest it's not the most popular. Still, if you're looking for a challenge or want to create a loop from nearby trails, the Blue Creek-Allen Canyon Trail (013) may be the ticket.

There isn't a defined parking area at the southern end of the trail, but with a little searching, you should be able to find a spot to park that's not too far away. The trail begins along an old, rocky road that follows a rounded ridgeline for about a mile until it reaches a large dusty intersection. From here, head to the right through a nice patch of trees. Almost immediately, you're confronted with a split in the singletrack.

This is one of the unclear sections of this trail, as the area can be heavily crossed with animal trails. Taking the left split, you soon cross over a drainage zone before climbing toward a scree field to the east. Depending on the conditions, you may be better suited to head right. Just make sure you end up at the scree field.

On the other side of the scree, the trail soon crosses a streambed and heads into a thick forest. The initial climb here is steep, but it soon backs off. As the trail leaves the tree cover, it heads toward a large bare slope. 

This is another area that suffers from an unclear path. Follow the narrow singletrack across a creek crossing as it angles up the barren slope en route to a nearby saddle. If the trail fizzles out before you reach the saddle, simply head right and keep climbing until you reach the clearly defined Skyline Trail (015). The view along this section is superb, so make sure to spin around a few times.

Almost immediately, the trail separates at the edge of the saddle. Head for a wide gap in the vegetation that leads to the rounded ridgeline to your left, then turn to the right and keep climbing. After a half mile, the trail drops down the other side of the ridge and begins the long descent.

Over the next two miles, the descent drops through the forest, briefly follows the edge of a ridgeline, and enters a large meadow. Head diagonally right through the grass to momentarily overlap with the Blue Creek-Tuerto Trail (014) before they separate next to two old buildings. Head to the left for more steady descending.

As you approach a reservoir, plenty of trail braiding obscures the main route. Fortunately, it doesn't matter too much, just pick up the trail in the small valley just past the reservoir. The trail remains pretty clear from here to its end in a junction with the Tuerto Trail (011).

Right away, the trail follows an old road trace, making two creek crossings before staying close to the banks of Hop Creek for the next two miles. Before departing this section, look for a colorfully striped mesa.

From here, the trail continues to climb toward Shay Mesa through scrubby juniper. The contours and ridges in this area translate into easy going along the sandy trail. You'll cross over a few more drainages, but don't expect much in the way of shade.

At around four miles, the trail descends into a shallow draw before ramping up for a steep climb on the other side. After navigating an additional series of drainages, the trail pretty much heads straight up, with little in the way of switchbacks to offset the grade. 

This steady climbing peaks at a small ridge at the edge of the mesa. The views are pretty nice from here, which is great because you'll probably feel like taking a break. An easy beeline to the FS Road (104) is all that separates you from the end of the trail.

0.5,Point to Point,7720,7626,95,23,4,10,Outlook,Intermediate,2.0,"        This is a pleasant, mostly level connector between the Deer Crest and Spin Cycle trails. Enjoy the easy stroll contouring around Deer Crest neighborhood with good views of Bald Mountain and the Jordanelle Reservoir.  Note: bikes are allowed on this trail.

0.8,Point to Point,7573,7354,5,224,5,7,Loose Moose,Intermediate,2.0,"        This multi-use trail is open for downhill travel only, whether you are a biker, hiker, runner or something else.  Starting just under the Payday chairlift at a switchback mid-way down Jenni's Trail, Loose Moose heads downhill at a mellow grade ensured by the numerous switchbacks.  End up at another random switchback on the lower part of CMG (this part of CMG is for downhill biking only, but folks on foot can go either direction).  You'll cross a couple of ski runs, but mostly be hiking through aspen woodlands next to the alpine coaster.

1.5,Point to Point,8572,7032,1540,0,19,67,Sundown Backside,Difficult,2.0,"        This is the old service road that was used to get the heavy machinery up to the top of the mountain to build the ski resort.

This trail is easy to miss if you are not looking for it. The trail breaks from the Wolf Creek Canyon Trail at roughly the 2-mile mark. It is located on the south-southeast side of the Wolf Creek Canyon Trail about 2 miles from the Powder Mountain Road.

0.8,Point to Point,7342,7058,21,291,7,16,Upper Village Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        Starting in the treed hillside just south and above the Deer Crest neighborhood guard house area (near Snow Top Road), the Upper Village Trail crosses and then follows Deer Crest Estate Drive briefly. Rock cairns mark where the trail leaves the road and descends through scrubby trees towards the Mountaineer Express chairlift. Gentle switchbacks wind through mature aspens before crossing the Deer Hollow ski run, rejoining the trees and finally ending at the base of the Mountaineer Express chairlift.  Note:  bikes are allowed on this trail.

6.2,Point to Point,8201,6738,1504,66,5,12,Adams Corral Road FR 052,Easy,2.0,"        From the intersection with the Cowley Canyon/Herd Hollow Road (FR 047), the road ascends and passes by a couple of springs. Soon after, it reaches an intersection with the Richards Hollow 019G trail, and from here the trail affords great views of The Elbow area and the surrounding forests.

Continuing along, the road skirts around The Elbow from above, and soon passes the junction to the Card Canyon East trail (which goes off to the right and drops down Card Canyon). From here, the road continues and gives great views of the ponds that form in the upper end of Richards Hollow, as well as the beautiful conifer forests all around. Soon, it passes the intersection with FR 151, which takes you down to Card Canyon West, and shortly thereafter splits into two roads. 

The main road, which continues up the mountainside is FR 168 which goes up to Logan Peak and the Providence Canyon, Millville Canyon areas. The fork to the left is the continuation of the Adams Corral FR 052 road, which soon passes another trail that goes down to Richards Hollow, and then eventually ends at Adams Corral. Near the corral is another trail that splits off and goes to Providence Cave, a great cave for spelunking that plenty of local spelunkers explore.

2.3,Point to Point,8666,8373,301,276,5,13,White Pine Basin Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        The White Pine Basin is simply a short cut if you have someone in your group that needs to get back to the parking area. If taken from the parking lot, there is a mild descent, followed by a moderate climb once you've intersected with the Brim Trail. The trail in the meadow is a simple doubletrack with no features worth mentioning. There is an excellent viewpoint at the end of this trail, but you'll want to use the Brim Trail to access the overlook! The meadow section of the trail is a gentle doubletrack, but the views are pleasant and worth while.

It's worth noting that the character of the trail changes slightly after the meadow portion. From about the 1.25 mile mark, the trail becomes a strenuous little out and back with an amazing view of the Pineview Reservoir. Just head up the doubletrack on the south end of the Brim Trail and work your way to the top. The view looking back into Powder Mountain is spectacular and worth the grind. 

Even though this is a doubletrack it does not feel like you are on a dirt road. Instead, the trail seems more like you are on parallel single tracks. You'll need to switch from one side to the other as you work your way up and down the trail.
    ",UT
3.7,Point to Point,9318,8415,902,587,8,15,Road 5113/0172,Intermediate,2.0,"        This is just a dirt road (closed to cars, but open to ATVs and bikes), and not a destination, but it connects to some great singletrack, including the Spring Creek Trail (159) and Robertson Pasture Trail.  It's got a smooth surface, and the hills are a little steep but technically easy.
    ",UT
5.1,Point to Point,8425,6364,2137,76,8,28,Chimney Park / Horse Flat Trail (010),Difficult,2.0,"        Throughout this trail, you'll encounter plenty of intersecting road-traces. As a general rule of thumb stay on the most traveled route. The area is quite dry and there is little to no shade for the duration.

From the bottom, follow the sandy road as it switchbacks away from South Cottonwood Road (106). As you pass below an early outcropping, a beautiful view briefly opens into the steep white canyon to the west. Settle in for a steady and moderate climb at the one mile mark before the trail levels out for a few miles of rolling elevation.

This reprieve ends as the trail rounds a low ridgeline and starts to climb in earnest. The next mile is a sustained, steep climb up another ridgeline. The surrounding vegetation does get greener as you gain elevation, and your chances of catching some shade improve as well. Make sure to take a look over your shoulder as you go, the vista below is quite nice.

The climbing doesn't stop, but it does back off for a short section before making another steep, non-stop climb to the end of the trail where this route connects to an unnamed Forest Service Road.

1.0,Point to Point,7053,6616,0,437,8,14,Lower Village Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        The Lower Village Trail starting from the base of the Mountaineer Express chairlift passes gently downhill though pleasant woods paralleling Deer Hollow Road. Upon leaving the trees and reaching a maintenance shed, turn left on Deer Creek Estates Drive, cross Deer Hollow Road, and follow Deer Hollow Road downhill until just past Harmony Drive. 

Turn left on a dirt and partially paved unmarked service road before reaching another ski area maintenance shed. Follow the wide, grassy Jordanelle ski run downhill, through a tunnel to the base of the Jordanelle Gondola.  The Lower Village trail is about half singletrack, half dirt road/ski run.  Note: bikes are allowed on this trail.
    ",UT
1.0,Point to Point,8081,7462,620,0,12,25,Little Stick,Intermediate,2.0,"        Little Stick can be used in either direction to connect the Silver Lake Village area at the base of Bald Mountain with the Deer Crest area trails. It is primarily a doubletrack dirt road that follows the Little Stick ski run. Several short sections are covered by singletrack switchbacks which can get loose and rutted. There are a couple of peaceful wooded sections and fleeting views of the Frog Valley, but otherwise the trail is pretty unaesthetic.  Note: bikes are allowed on this trail.

0.4,Point to Point,7324,7287,38,3,2,3,Gap Bypass,Intermediate,2.0,"        The navigation on this hillside behind the lodging lining Deer Valley Drive East can be confusing at first, mostly due to multiple junctions, similar trail names, and signposts that label trails in addition to giving directions to neighboring trails. Gap Bypass trail is named as such on the paper summer trail maps, but is not given this name on the trailside signposts. 

Gap Bypass trail leaves from Finn's connector and traverses around the scrub covered hillside. The gentle uphill ends at the Deer Crest neighborhood guardhouse on McKinley Gap Road. Enjoy views of the ski runs on Bald Mountain as well as down to the lakes of Frog Valley. This dry trail does not provide much shade but scattered wildflowers appear instead. The trail surface is packed dirt with some small loose rocks.  Note: bikes are allowed on this trail.

0.9,Point to Point,9292,8439,858,6,18,38,Tuerto to Skyline Trail (457),Difficult,2.0,"        This short and steep climb connects the Tuerto Trail (011) to the Skyline Trail (015). Parts of this infrequently used trail are faint, so it shouldn't be your first choice for making a loop, but it's an option if you need it.
    ",UT
1.3,Point to Point,8274,7225,0,1049,15,33,Holman Ridge - Cabin Flat #172,Difficult,2.0,"        Holman Ridge - Cabin Flat #172 is the extension of Old Trench Road #181. This route is very steep with a section of sustained grades of 18-22%. It is also very rugged with rocks and a loose tread surface. In other words, it's not everyones idea of a good time.

This is a good bail-out option from Holman Trail #039 to access Mill Canyon #40.

1.7,Point to Point,8734,8350,406,37,5,9,FR #181,Easy,2.0,"        This forest road starts off of Highway 191 and climbs through a gap in the snow fence into the hills east of Dyer Mountain. The road is well defined and generally maintained. 

It's most frequently traveled to reach the yurt at the top of Bassett Springs Trail #152B (Grizzly Ridge Yurt). It also intersects with Trail #153, Trail #153A, FR #279, and FR #575.
    ",UT
1.7,Point to Point,6002,5885,44,140,2,6,Crossroads,Easy,2.0,"        Starting from the east, the trail is dead flat and uninteresting until you cross the road.  On the western side of the road, the trail gets much more interesting as it winds through juniper, sage, and Mormon tea plants.  

Overall, this is hardly a destination trail, but makes for good loops for a longer hike.
    ",UT
3.2,Point to Point,8576,7428,55,1150,7,25,Gooseberry Trail (445),Intermediate,2.0,"        The Gooseberry Trail (445) connects East Gooseberry Road (094) with South Cottonwood Road (106) over the course of three miles along a rocky road trace. The rocky road trace has plenty of steeper sections that can be slick after periods of rain or snow.

From the top, look for the faint road trace off of East Gooseberry Road (094). The trail heads south-east along a gradual climb through scattered trees. After less than a half mile, the trail begins to descend as a grand vista of the adjacent valley comes into view.

Soon, the rocky doubletrack meanders alongside an eroded slope. At no point does the trail get too close to the edge, but curious hikers may want to venture out for a better view. A steep descent continues over the next few miles and many of the views are once again hidden.

Eventually, the grade mellows out near a meadow, followed by a series of switchbacks. As the trail continues, it turns north and maintains a gradual descent until it connects with South Cottonwood Road (106).
    ",UT
1.6,Point to Point,4766,4632,134,13,2,9,Rockin' A,Intermediate,2.0,"        The trail can be used in either direction, but this description is for a clockwise loop: 

Leaving the Bar-M Loop at the Circle-O's southern trailhead, hike 1/4 mile on dirt doubletrack to the berm bowl at the junction with the Rockin' A trail. This is where the real fun begins.  

Head right (SE) from the berm bowl to follow the Rockin-A trail (it's well signed). The path is marked by a rust-colored line painted on the Entrada sandstone. Follow this line for nearly 2 miles as it winds through tight turns, over quick dips, and down short steps. This slickrock is slightly more difficult than the Circle-O trail, but more fun. You'll come to the junction with Bar-M and can return to the trailhead on this trail, or continue south on the Bar-B Loop.
    ",UT
5.7,Point to Point,5244,4925,688,432,4,17,Baby Steps Loop 4x4,Intermediate,2.0,"        This is most often done as a way to connect all the great singletrack in the Klondike Bluffs area.

Starting on the south end, after reaching the start from Baby Steps South, you'll wind around washes on slickrock and sand.  It's never very difficult, but the white paint trail markers are sometimes hard to find, so keep your eye out.  You'll pass several nice singletrack options (Baby Steps Singletrack Loop 1 and Baby Steps Singletrack Loop 2), some dinosaur tracks if you can find them, and then arrive at the junction with UFO.

Take a right and continue wandering around slickrock until you intersect the Klondike Bluff 4x4.  Go left, up a steep ridge, and then enjoy some descending through the Salt Valley.

After a long straightaway, you'll take a sharp left and climb back up to the mesa, where you'll again wind around slickrock that is smooth, and fun!

There are excellent signs at all trail intersections.

0.6,Point to Point,7426,7327,114,40,5,8,Mid Gap,Intermediate,2.0,"        The navigation on this hillside behind the lodging lining Deer Valley Drive East can be confusing at first, mostly due to multiple junctions, similar trail names, and signposts that label trails in addition to giving directions to neighboring trails. Mid Gap trail is so named on the trailside signposts but is not labeled like this on the paper summer trail maps.  

Mid Gap starts from junction area just uphill from the Deer Crest neighborhood guardhouse on McKinley Gap Road. Head up steep switchbacks through thistle, scrub oak and stunted aspen trees. The angle eases off considerably after the switchbacks end and the trail contours back around the hillside towards the St. Regis funicular. Views of Bald Mountain and the lakes of Frog Valley appear in the distance.  Note: bikes are allowed on this trail.
    ",UT
1.1,Point to Point,5177,4854,108,325,8,18,Deuel Creek South Link Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        This is the best way, in my opinion, to connect the Bonniville Shoreline Trail to Deuel Creek. You could, of course, take the road, but you may have to compete with vehicles on their way to the rifle range.
    ",UT
1.8,Point to Point,7492,6497,996,1,11,29,Reservoir Canyon Trail (008),Intermediate/Difficult,2.0,"        As its name suggests, the Reservoir Canyon Trail (008) climbs out of Reservoir Canyon from its intersection with the Vega Creek Trail (164). 

From the trail junction, the first half mile is spent gradually winding through scrubby bushes before tackling the slope. All of the elevation gain is focused into a series of tightly packed switchbacks that end atop the canyon rim on Forest Road 096 (Maverick Point).

While you'll earn some nice views as you slog up the trail, its rocky and rutted nature doesn't make for the most enjoyable hike.

1.3,Point to Point,8606,8288,327,62,6,15,West Wagon Road Loop Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        The West Wagon Road Loop Trail departs from about mid-way along the Wagonwheel Trail #168.  Begin by heading northwest on a gentle climb along a bench. The two-track trail surface can be muddy after a rain, but otherwise consists of somewhat loose, rocky patches interspersed with more packed areas. 

Travel though piney woods and dry, scrubby vegetation. Soon after a steeper gradient, hikers arrive at a ""Y"" intersection where the ""head"" of the lollipop starts. Complete the circle in either direction, visiting primitive camp spots, an overgrown overlook and nice views of a rugged cliff-band to the north. The trail is faint here, so keep your eye out. Upon arrival back at the ""Y"" intersection, tramp down the ""stem"" of the lollipop until it deposits you back at the Wagonwheel Trail #168.

Fall colors are pretty here, but be sure to wear orange during hunting season as this area is popular with motorized hunting parties.

The grade is gentle but continuous, and this is one of the easier ways up to the top of the Klondike Bluff trail system.  

On the slickrock sections, the white paint is wearing away, so pay attention.

1.2,Point to Point,4972,4351,621,8,10,27,Middle Pass,Difficult,2.0,"        This is the only viable place to scramble out of Buckskin Gulch once you're deep in the narrows. The 100 to 200-foot walls run nearly uninterrupted for a dozen miles, except for at this one spot. Here, the canyon makes a 90-degree turn and on the outside wall there is a low-angle gully leading to the rim. It requires some scrambling, but is doable even with a heavy pack on. The passage is about 6.5 miles below the Wire Pass/Buckskin confluence, and 5.3 miles above the Buckskin/Paria confluence.

People have used this passage to escape floodwaters in the canyon, but there's no guarantee you'll be able to reach this spot once water starts flowing. It's good to know about, not to rely on.

You could also use Middle Pass if something else goes wrong on your trip, like an injury or hypothermia. The caveat is that once you get up the gully and onto the rim, you're pretty much in the middle of nowhere. You'll have to hike through open desert -- following a wash and scrambling through a slabby cliffband -- for more than a mile northward to reach a primitive dirt road. 

Don't expect any cars to come by once you're there. It is possible to walk to either White House Trail or House Rock Valley Road in a few more hours using two-tracks and washes, but you'll need to navigate miles of rather featureless desert to be successful.
    ",UT
3.2,Point to Point,7386,6783,0,603,4,7,Sheep Creek Trail,Intermediate,1.7,"        Backpackers primarily use the lengthy Sheep Creek Trail either as a way to exit the park (in the N-S direction) or as a way of entering the park without paying a fee (S-N direction).  

From the 4-way intersection with the Under-the-Rim Trail and the Sheep Creek Connecting Trail, the Sheep Creek Trail follows Sheep Creek wash along the canyon bottom. Descend past Swamp Canyon, the Sheep Creek backcountry campsite and cross the national park boundary near Short Canyon as the canyon progressively broadens.  

After Mud Canyon, the trail joins a dirt fire road (115B) and turns to the east. Navigate past Pasture Wash and the heavily wooded Noon Canyon before reaching the Sheep Creek Trailhead and parking area at the end of Sheep Creek Flat Road. The trailhead is on Dixie National Forest land, just inside the BLM land boundary.

1.2,Point to Point,5783,5206,589,12,10,33,BST: Richland Drive Access,Difficult,1.3,"        This is a typical Wasatch butt kicker. It starts off mild but only grows steeper, smartly approaching the main Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST): Dry Creek to City Creek  trail, arriving at Bobsled after about a mile of mostly shadeless hiking. 

This route begins from a residential neighborhood, so please remember to be respectful on your hike!

10.7,Point to Point,5751,5197,650,728,2,12,24-Hours of Moab,Difficult,1.5,"        This trail runs through beautiful terrain and often punishing conditions. It parallels, then joins with the Behind the Rocks road to complete a roughly 15-mile loop.

With about twice your recommended daily allowance of sand, the trail is harder than the mileage would suggest. Many stretches are more likely to be used by OHVs than anything else.

Despite a few really nice sections, this one really isn't worth doing unless you're curious about the famous 24-hour race that used to be run here.

5.0,Point to Point,8141,6951,154,1222,5,13,Bulldog Trail (504),Intermediate,1.0,"        There is a tangled mass of spaghetti-like trails in this southeast corner of Manti La Sal National Forest. The Bull Dog Trail is a good choice for folks looking for a straight-shot descent from the South Peak area to Highway 191 and nearby Devils Canyon Campground. 

The Bulldog Trail (also called 504) branches off the 0084 fire road and heads south. The downhill hiking is gentle at first, passing through wooded sections and occasional pretty aspen groves. Substantial erosion has gouged some hiker-eating troughs in this trail. When not negotiating these tricky spots, the trail becomes more mellow and enjoyable, dropping at a steady gradient. The smoother sections are a bit monotonous as you wind through dense forest. 

Although there are fewer turn-offs and confusing trail junctions on this trail than others in this area, towards the bottom you need to be careful to stay on the right track. Some paths dead-end in campsites and others send you into the wrong drainage. Use the Hiking Project mobile app to stick to the right trail. A final short uphill climb at the end brings you back to civilization with a bit of a view before the trail terminates at Alkali Pt. Road.

Fall colors are pretty here, but be sure to wear orange during hunting season as this area is popular with motorized hunting parties.

1.8,Point to Point,6621,5558,1119,56,12,31,Highland Oaks Trail,Difficult,1.0,"        The First Ridge Trail would be do-able all but for a brief strip of private property overlapping the jeep road.  The trail shown here circumvents that private property. Unfortunately, much of this trail is very overgrown and hard to follow. Nevertheless, it is worth noting it as an alternative to trespassing.

On my hike, I ran into a swampy section, followed by a decomposing deer carcass. The trail can be accessed from the end of Highland Oaks Drive where there is an easement where I am fairly certain hiking is legal. It would help if there was a sign, but at the time of this writing, there is no sign whatsoever, only a trail and some parking spaces.

It takes the path of least resistance in connecting the north and south Klondike Bluff trailheads.  There is no climbing, no technical difficulties, and not much of a reason to use it.

You might take this trail if you need to get back to a trailhead but there are much better options to either side: Jasper Loop and Agate Loop to the west or Dino-Flow to the east.

As far as washes go, this one is pretty bad, as it is almost entirely sand. There is one area of flat rock about halfway through that offers some respite from constant sinking and trudging, but it's about 50 feet. Suitable for masochists and hardship training runs, not much else.
    ",UT
0.9,Point to Point,8977,8526,452,0,9,15,Wagonwheel to Fr 0087,Intermediate/Difficult,1.0,"        This gradually narrowing 2-track dirt road climbs part-way up the flank of South Peak. The trail surface is somewhat loose and rutted. Climb up two benches through scrubby trees and dry vegetation, occasionally getting glimpses of the hillside from small clearings. This is a less interesting and less pretty way to reach the Abajo Peak Rd (FR0087) from the Wagonwheel Trail (168). 

Fall colors are pretty here, but be sure to wear orange during hunting season as this area is popular with motorized hunting parties.

0.2,Point to Point,5460,5419,41,0,4,8,Main Line Beginner Trail,Easy,1.0,"        This short, nearly flat beginner trail is designed for both bikes and foot traffic. It is wider than the others in this trail system, so it is more forgiving and allows for multi-directional travel. This trail has very little elevation gain and is smooth. It goes up the gut of the valley, eventually ending at the top of the instructional trail system. The trails in this area are well signed.

10.3,Point to Point,9280,7253,2334,1382,7,38,Great Western Trail: Sessions Mountain Road to Francis Peak,Intermediate/Difficult,,"        This section of the GWT starts at the top of Ward Canyon Road which is also the North end of Session's Mountain Road and the South end of Sky-line drive.  Most cars can reach it without any problems.  The trail begins as a wonderful hike descending through thick forest with a few stream crossings and craggy formations before reaching the Farmington Flats area.  This area is characterized by a curious color of sand (I always called it ""indian sand""), and is frequented by ATVs.  The Farmington Flats area is a network of ATV trails that includes Chicken Creek Loop, and Gold Ridge.  (I've motor-biked them both many times.)  Exiting Farmington Flats area, you arrive at the shed that begins Francis Peak road.  From here you can drop into Morgan or go down Farmington Canyon.  Continuing on the GWT, you'll eventually reach Francis Peak.  Best to go around it than over it to avoid radiation exposure.  Beyond that, you reach a fork.  Going right takes you to the Smith Creek Lakes (there are 3 of them.)  Going left continues the GWT towards Thurston Peak.  Now go to the description for GWT: I-84 to Francis Peak.

The trail then becomes much more manageable as it links up with the Francis Peak trail.

On the start of the scramble up to the switch-back, it is not uncommon to encounter items that people have dumped from the canyon road above, or broken skeets (clay targets) left over from shooters.

2.9,Point to Point,8903,5837,3070,4,20,56,Old North,Difficult,,"        I've done this trail many times in the summer and winter (with snow shoes). Branching off the Davis Creek Loop trail, you immediately cross a creek heading north, then the trail turns eastward and becomes steep and overgrown. Pop-can bottoms here (and in almost all other places, by the way) help you make sure you're on the right path as the trail becomes harder to follow. 

Eventually you'll find two trees, each with a pop-can bottom, marking the right-turn you'll need to make to begin the first switchback that will take you to the south shoulder of the false peak, I believe called Midway Peak.  Hike right between the two said trees. As you continue upward, the trail may disappear, leaving you to look for the next pop-can bottom or other form of tree-tag. If you don't see one, just follow your nose.

On the return, you sometimes have to look behind you to see the pop-can bottoms as they were placed to be visible for someone ascending, not descending the trail.

The terrain ranges from paved roads to severely sloped singletrack.

69.1,Point to Point,2966,1241,8652,8603,5,42,Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail,Difficult,4.5,"        The 70-mile hiking trail stretches along Laurel Mountain from the picturesque Youghiogheny River At Ohiopyle, Pa. to the Conemaugh Gorge near Johnstown, Pa. The trail features overnight trail shelters that must be reserved in advance. Seasoned backpackers challenge themselves on the steep, rugged areas of the trails. Casual hikers and runners enjoy areas that are reasonably level and pleasant for walking.

The trail traverses state parks, state forests, state game lands, other public lands and private lands. The Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail is a major segment of the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail, a network of trails between the mouth of the Potomac River and the Allegheny Highlands. Click here for more info.

The Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail is open year-round and is blazed approximately every 100 feet with 2-inch and 5-inch yellow blazes. Connector trails lead to and from trailheads and shelter areas and are marked with blue blazes. Mileage monuments are every mile. Yellow bands around trees mark the trail at every major road crossing.

A hiker's guide to the Laurel Highlands Trail is available from the Sierra Club Allegheny Group. The guide describes the trail and aids in planning outings. Included in the guide are detailed topographic maps plus information on geology, climate, plants and wildlife.

Trailheads 
Six trailheads provide 30-car parking lots, overnight parking and trash receptacles.

Voluntary day use registration mailboxes are located in each of the trailheads for day hikers to fill out information cards for vital park attendance data and for use in an emergency. For overnight use of the trail see the LHHT Regulations section.

5.9,Point to Point,212,103,419,413,3,15,Orange Trail,Intermediate,4.7,"        The trail starts on Germantown Avenue where the road crosses Wissahickon Creek. It ends down at Historic Rittenhouse Town. 

In between is a pretty technical set of trails that take you through some really pretty territory. 

The trail winds down the Wissahickon Creek and passes by covered bridges, dams, light rapids and crosses streams. 

Check out the covered bridge in the first third of the trail and the Fingerspan bridge sculpture in the last third. This sculpture had to be helicoptered into place!

The trail is not marked very clearly, so make sure you pay attention at intersections etc. When in doubt stay closer to the creek and use the Hiking Project mobile app to make sure you stay on track.

27.6,Point to Point,1564,1073,3692,3692,5,32,Gerard Hiking Trail,Intermediate,4.6,"        There are several parking areas at the Park Office at Petroleum Center. The trail starts directly behind the park office, and goes up a steep hill, following white blazes. In about a half a mile, there will be a sign that directs trail goers towards Miller Farm, following the yellow blazes. Visitors will follow the yellow blazed Girard trail for approximately 15 miles on the eastern side of Oil Creek, descending into the Oil Creek Valley, then ascending back up to the ridges several times.  The trail is mainly dirt singletrack, with numerous roots and rocks, a few muddy areas, but nothing terribly technical or difficult.

Once the visitor descends after 15 miles, they will cross a single-lane car-bridge (Jersey Bridge), go through a parking lot and up a paved bike trail for about two tenths of a mile.  They will then make a right onto the Gerard trail again, marked by a sign hanging over the singletrack trail.  Again, trail users will ascend and descend through the Oil Creek valley, staying on the Yellow blazed trail on the west side of Oil Creek.  There are several white blazed side trails, which cross the valley.  Be cautious of several road crossings - though not busy, drivers can be traveling quickly.  Once you come down to an Oil Derrick tableau, you'll come down a hill to a wooden arch bridge that brings visitors to a paved road. Cross over this road to the trail, and continue on for about a mile.  You'll come to another dirt road, and you'll turn left on this road to get back to the Petroleum Center parking area.

This long trail can be accessed from several points. The easiest access points are the Jersey Bridge parking area near Drake's Well Park or from the Oil Creek State Park park office at Petroleum Center which is how the trail is shown mapped here. There are permanent pit toilets located at the Petroleum Center parking areas, as well as water at the park office. During spring, summer and fall, there are port-a-johns located at the Jersey Bridge Parking area.  Maps are available at the Park office or at the parking area at Jersey Bridge.

3.8,Point to Point,2903,2522,543,520,5,28,McCune Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.7,"        This trail passes through various habitats and by evidence of the McCune Farm. Around mile 1, Hikers can see a stone foundation and an old springhouse and pond that serve as remnants of this working farm. The trail runs along the highest ridge in the park. 

The first half of the trail is very easy hiking along a wide, well-maintained trail. At the halfway point, there is a bench with a nice view overlooking the Youghiogheny River Valley. The second half of the trail is narrower with some inclines and is heavily forested with no more vistas, so feel free to turn back at the bench overlook if you're not looking for something wilder. 

The second half of the trail does include some old boulders, including one around 30 feet high that you can climb to the top. 

This is a lightly used and secluded trail, and it is a loop that brings you back to the small parking lot (which may fit 3-4 vehicles) at the trailhead.

0.5,Point to Point,1362,595,767,0,29,53,Thousand Steps Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Parking, as well as the trailhead, are on the side of US 22. Care must be taken, due to the fact that the trailhead is to the east of the parking area, and hiking near the road for a short distance is required. 

At the trailhead, signs describe the rules, trail, and history of the trail. According to the display, the steps were built in the 1930's for miners as they made their way to the Ledge Quarry, a sandstone mine. 

The steps start almost immediately and lead up the mountain. The trail is a tough 0.5 miles, but pull-offs are present for the occasional break. The steps are numbered every 100 so progress can be measured; each 100 is a worthy accomplishment! The usual fauna and flora of the area surround the trail, and it is a very enjoyable experience (one may not think so on the way up, but look around on the return trip!). 

Once the top step is achieved (step 1037 to be exact), a well-deserved rest is in order. If the quaking legs allow, a right (south) at the top of the steps is the Mount Union View Trail, and a left is the Standing Stone Trail-State Game Land 112 Segment. Return to the parking area on the same trail. Be careful on the way down; the steps are often slippery in the winter as they may be snow and ice covered.

1.5,Point to Point,1726,1246,1,480,6,20,Lingle Valley Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Lingle Valley Trail is like taking a journey to the Land of the Lost. Surely pterodactyls have hunkered down to weather the millennia in this jumbly thicket of singletrack goodness.

This challenging downhill run crosses the stream no less than five times and winds its way through thick rhododendron bushes. One of the most unusual, beautiful, and thoroughly enjoyable trails in Cooper's Gapwith some serious steeps (in a couple early sections). So, do be a tad careful. 

Accessing this superb trail is done off of Chestnut Spring Trail, marked by a wooden post. You'll immediately start dropping like a stone, then you'll cross an old school bridge over the beginnings of Little Kettle Creek. Once you pass this, you'll soon find yourself among more moderate grades. There are a couple BIG logs, with stone and wooden ramps over them (for the bikers; you can probably just step over them..). The stream crossings are all wadeable (if the water is not at peak heights) and the trail twists like a dervish through crazy rhododendron land. 

At the end of the trail, you'll come out at a hunting camp.

Starting from the end of Fire Lane, enter the trail staying left at the first two forks.  You'll know you are on the correct path when you come to a 10' long wooden bridge.  Be careful at this bridge.  It tends to dip 1-2' in the middle, giving a little springboard launch as you cross over.

From this point on there are no major intersecting trails other than Concrete Block, which is easy enough to miss.  At the end of the trail you'll be standing above a baseball field, and what might be the highest point in Frick Park.  

With 350' of climb in under a mile, this trail tests conditioning.  For extra ""fun"" hit it up in winter when snow and ice have formed.

3.6,Point to Point,1994,1660,86,370,2,10,Little Mountain Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        Little Mountain Trail would be over run with people if it was just near somewhere else, or it was easier to link into other hikes. As it is though, it's worth the effort it takes to get to it. 

After a short uphill, the trail is mostly all down over pretty easy grades. The trail can be quite rugged and rocky. There is a section referred to as ""the Slot"" where the trail goes through a 30 inch gap in two shoulder high boulders. 

The only intersection is a bit tricky, as Little Mountain actually veers right slightly but continues on the ridge. Al; maps show this intersection as being a right angle 4 way intersection, but that's not how it looks in real life, so be careful.

This trail has a good amount of elevation change throughout. Begin the hike in the direction mapped by taking Berry Patch or Ridge to their NW terminus. All of these trails converge at a scenic area that overlooks the lake. Take in the view, and start Rays there. 

The first two miles of this trail are definitely the most fun, since most of it is DOWN. From the overlook, youll lose about 300 feet in this section.

The decision making arrives at the end of the downhill. If you are heading back to the Bakers Hollow Lot, take Sidewinder down hike up Osprey to take the quickest way back via Fawn or Doe. Going up on Sidewinder will be a bit longer by taking Loco Motive, Red Legs, Grippis and Allie.

From the intersection with Dirt Surfer and Shade, Allegheny has a steep-ish but short climb before an enjoyable descent to a road crossing. From there the downhill continues as it contours around steep hillsides. If you take a moment to check out the hillside below, you might notice how high up you are.  At some points you'll feel like you're hiking through the tree canopy. 

There's one more rugged climb and short descent before reaching the far end of Allegheny where it meets a junction with Dirt Surfer and Barrel Bay.  Stay left for a shorter connection back to Shade or stay right for a longer hike on Barrel Bay.

1.6,Point to Point,1505,1225,324,46,4,12,Deer Tick Trail,Difficult,5.0,"        A multiple switchback ascent out of Cooper's Gap, this climb is definitely not the easy way to the top. There are lots of roots and rocks, with a few steep pitches thrown in. However, it's pretty much the only way up at that end of the valley. 

The first stretch from Cooper's Gap up to the unnamed haul road used to be called ""Long Cut"", basically because it takes a long time to go a short distance. Once you cross the haul road, you've got a short steep climb before you get to Deer Tick proper. Be on the look out for a sharp right, as it's easy to miss. If you do miss it, the trail loops around and doubles back in about 75 feet. It's probably the only trail with a cul de sac. 

The climb up is very cool, as it crosses through multiple forest stages and opens up into a nice hard wood forest. There are some great rock formations and if you look over your shoulder, you can catch glimpses of Big Valley off in the distance.

It works great in either direction, but the aastern end has some of the most difficult rock features and tightest tree gaps of any place in the forest. 

The trail connects several feed plots along Coopers Gap, so it's not uncommon to hear the buzz of swarms of honey bees working the apple trees in these clearings. Supposedly Rich Wertz, the trail builder, followed a bear's meanderings through the woods to come up with the layout.

The trail ends at an odd intersection which funnels headfirst wrong-way into the TD4W descent. Do Not Enter! Instead, climb the switchbacks to the right or exit down towards the carousel.

Kiester Trail and Great Gorge Trail, the Beech Trail starts with a whisper, barely acknowledging the rocky terrain that makes up the majority of this trail. In only a quarter mile, the trail turns rocky as the rock climb walls come into view. 

Running just off the foot of the wall, the trail consists of one foot diameter, and smaller, rocks that have broken free of the wall. Rock climbers frequent the area giving hikers the chance to watch as they scramble up the wall. Be careful when taking your eyes off the trail because the terrain constantly changes. Always within view of the GAP, hikers can easily jump off the trail and back on if necessary. This section lasts for roughly a mile and half before taking a 90-degree turn into the wall face.

As you approach the wall, there is a small waterfall to your right.  At the wall face the trail takes a hard left turn, runs at the foot of the wall before a steep climb and switch back, followed by a steep climb of a few hundred feet (denoted on the map by the straight section running east and west immediately after the switch back.

There are several climbs of 200-300 feet at maybe 5-10% grades, but those are almost enjoyable in comparison to hiking downhill.  

The trail starts just up the road from the ""Point"" parking lot and, as part of the North Country Trail system, is blazed in a bright blue. From the start you are hiking among large boulders and must navigate your way down to Slippery Rock Creek.

You'll continue on until you reach the covered bridge. Cross the bridge, and the trail is on the left just 100 feet after exiting the bridge.

You'll stay on this trail for about a half mile to mile before reaching Eckert Bridge. Here you can connect with Kildoo Trail (the other side of Eckert Bridge) and head back to the covered bridge for a shorter loop (4 miles).  

The next part is the longest section and also takes you up the slope in 200 or 300 foot chunks.  You'll have some views of the creek, but this will be the mostly manageable, as up the slope is just about a rock-free section of the trail.  

You'll come to a sign with three planks calling out the Slippery Rock Trail, Hell's Hollow, and Walnut Flats. Continue towards Hell's Hollow (it's a right) along the Slippery Rock Trail. This is the best section of the entire trail, offering small pine cover, gorgeous sections along Hell's Hollow with views, and more gentle terrain.

The scenic and challenging Loyalsock Trail runs roughly parallel to its namesake creek. The name Loyalsock Creek is taken from the Indian phrase ""Lawi-Saquick,"" meaning middle creek, and flows between Muncy Creek and Lycoming Creek.

The trail takes advantage of long-abandoned timber roads and railroad grades, reminders of the logging industry.

What follows should be considered a rough sketch of a few featured sections:

PA Route 87 to Little Bear Road  Not even 5 miles, but it feels like much more:
This section begins with one of the notorious climbs to the Allegheny Ridge. Once on top, enjoy the smooth singletrack. Then, as you hike along the Allegheny Front, look to your right for views of the rolling farmland to the south. You'll know when you reach the infamous, steep, wet, mossy, slippery, path down Petes Hollow. Insider tip: Dont miss the stinging nettle patch that adorns this descent in the summer.

Little Bear Road to Dunwoody Road  A little over 10 miles:
Why not begin another section with a notorious climb? Toward the top, views of Loyalsock Creek make it all worthwhile. Traverse Smiths Knob, cross hemlock-lined Painter Run and savor the trail as you ascend Red Ridge. Youll appreciate some outstanding trail as you explore the headwaters of Shingle Run, Grandad Run, and Hessler Branch before reaching Dunwoody Road. Insider tip: The laurel blooms mid to late June.

Worlds End State Park to Route 220  13ish miles
The section has a bolder field called the rock stairs, visits High Rock Vista, has some smooth singletrack twisting through hemlock forest, and follows the historic Williamsport and North Branch Railroad grade.  Youll pass Alpine Falls, Sones Pond, and the Haystacks on your way to the eastern end of the LT.  Insider tip: you pass some of the best swimming holes on Loyalsock Creek

This is still the mountainous trail characteristic of the area. It is a fun-filled, varied challenge that mostly steadily descends the whole way.

Find the Miller trailhead at the North parking area, which also has Hess Trail and Whitetail Trail-Pine Knob Trail access points. The descent starts with a short rise, followed by turns, a few narrower sections, a little ruggedness, all leading up to a sketchier section over rocks and between trees. While exciting, there is nothing here that should deter confident hikers. At its terminus the Miller Trail meets Mill Run Trail which is stunning for its beauty as it courses along the valley floor next to the stream.

6.0,Point to Point,1237,1000,568,600,4,12,Red/Blue Blaze,Intermediate,4.2,"        The Red/Blue Blaze Trail is heavily used. It's an in-and-out path extends for 2 miles ""as a crow flies"" and is 6 miles of continuous, uninterrupted trail. This is a must-do hike for people in the Pittsburgh area, as it is only a few miles from the city but offers seclusion.

The Red/Blue Blaze Trail runs from North Ridge Road near the Ice Skating Rink to Irwin Run where Babcock Blvd intersects Pierce Mill Rd. The trail was originally constructed in the mid 1990's By Dave Brunger and Bill Kirk as the Rainbow Trail. This runs from the Skating Rink side to the Wisconsin Shelter. 

To find the trailhead from the Ice Skating rink side, start at the Olympia Shelter parking lot (across Pierce Mill Rd from the Skating Rink). Ride up North Ridge Rd for ~50 yards. The trail will start to your right. The trail winds up the initial ~.25 mile climb. The trail is continually marked with red/blue blazes, but does not cross any other trails. There are multiple opt-out locations in case you get tired or run short on time. All opt-outs put you on North Ridge Drive, which you can take northward and end up back at the double lot.

There are three stream crossings, two below the spillway and one up near the wall. The one up near the wall can be tricky if the side stream is flowing as the stepping stones are just below the surface and may be slippery.

Access Info:

1.8,Point to Point,350,224,188,202,4,23,Orange Trail,Intermediate,4.3,"        This is a beautiful, mostly easy hike when you have an hour to kill. Ridley Creek State Park is quite popular and can get a lot of foot traffic. I like this trail when I want to avoid the crowd. 

The parking lot is on the south side of Gradyville Rd and only a max of 5 or 6 cars can fit. The trail is well marked and easy to follow. It is a looped trail. About 600 feet in, it will fork and start its loop. Hiking left will take you up an incline deeper into the woods. Hiking right will take you along Ridley Creek.

My preferred path is to take the left fork and get a workout going up and back down the hill then finish it off with a peaceful hike along the creek.

After the left fork, the northeastern part of the trail is the most difficult and has several sections dense with roots so please watch your footing. In this section, the hike up the hill and back down will exceed 10% at some parts and may require getting a hand hold on some trees to assist with the ascent/descent.

The part of the trail along Ridley Creek is the easiest and offers many points with access to the creek for our four legged friends to cool off. Also, along this section of the trail you'll have to cross two water run-off points. They aren't a big deal on dry days, but take caution during raining hikes or if there was a good soaking rain the previous day.

At the top of Bald Knob the trail becomes very rocky. From Bald Knob, the trail traverses the top of the ridge, heading west back towards Shingletown Gap.

2.6,Point to Point,2269,1912,444,443,10,21,Hess Trail,Difficult,4.5,"        Hess is a wonderful, moderately rough singletrack, with varied features including rocks, small streams, some mud on a short section of doubletrack, and moderate climbs along with fun descents. It's marked by standard double-blazes but it could be missed. Hess is a great hike in either direction.

The Hess Trail starts at the trailhead parking area and is usually done to start the Clockwise Quebec Loop. You'll descend the steep section of the Hess Trail, which can be a wake up call because it is moderately steep and rough due to an abundance of small rocks. The junction with the Tebolt Trail is reached very quickly. From here the Hess Trail is mostly rough doubletrack and you'll find intersections with Whitetail Trail-Pine Knob Trail and Miller Trail further up the trail.

Most will turn left to continue on the Hess Trail as part of the Clockwise Quebec loop. This section is mountainous singletrack with a couple of small creek crossings and a few short, steep uphill sections. There are also several short stretches of fun downhill. At the terminus, you'll see Brocker Trail to your right and continue straight to stay on the Hess Trail.

The preferred direction to hike it is from west to east, which becomes readily apparent once you look at the elevation profile.

Cowbell Hollow Trail starts out as an access road to a large food plot planted by the Wild Turkey Federation. Stay to the left of the field to enter the trail proper. The trail quickly drops into a drainage where another trail bisects it. Stay straight here, and climb to the other side. At this point, the trail has ""naturalized"" into a ribbon of singletrack meanders through a slightly larger clearing. 

Shortly after this meander, the trail crests the rise and begins to gradually turn downhill. When you notice the forest change from newer trees and shrubs and begins to be dominated by larger trees, be prepared for the bottom to drop out of the trail. From this point on, the trail maintains a 10-15% downhill grade, with a few washed out sections. This continues for well over a mile. The end has a few wooden bridges that can be slick, so be careful. Eventually, the trail dumps you out at a cabin and just short of the road.

Once you find it, hike to the top of the ridge then turn left next to a rock wall. This is where it gets crazy. It is a very steep downhill with lots of rocks and saplings to maneuver around. 

If you make it through this section, you'll encounter a steep drop that brings you down to the stream. Cross over and hike the trail on the other side until you see a big tree down. Cross back over that. Once you cross back, enjoy some very technical rock sections on your way out to the switchback of Raccoon Mountain Trail.

Or you may park at Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve located at the north terminus.  

Starting from the south terminus, the trail weaves through a small wooded area with the road to the left and Squaw Run to the right. In less than a half mile, the trail peeks out of the woods at a small cinder pull off before taking a hard right and crossing Squaw Run via large stepping stones. From here, hikers will make a short steep climb up the hillside and hike a section of trail at the foot of Shady Side Academy. There are numerous trails in this section crisscrossing the main trail. The best advice is to stay to the left. You're on the correct path if you are hiking just above the roadway. You may also want to looks at the Hiking Project mobile app if you want to be absolutely sure.

You'll exit the woods and hike through a parking lot leading to a dog park with a wooden gate. Dogs are off leash, and hikers should take caution when opening the gate to enter and exit. There are several paths you can take, all of which lead to the back of the park. Shortly after all the paths converge, you'll see a trail marker (concrete or wooden posts with a green circle and white arrow pointing the direction) directing you up a steep climb. While traveling south to north, the trail is always heading uphill; this is by far the biggest climb and toughest section. There is an equally long descent on the other end.  

When you exit the woods again, you'll see a small concrete block shed and another trail sign (this time brown with yellow print). You'll cross over Squaw Run once again, using large stepping stones. Then hikers will cross the roadway and begin the last section of trail, most of which is doubletrack.

This last section starts out slow, but less than mid-way through the climb begins to Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve. Fortunately, the ascent is at a low grade.

Hikers can extend their hike by entering Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve, which has glut of singletrack trails.

26.5,Point to Point,2957,1720,3560,2931,5,22,Lost Turkey Trail,Difficult,4.1,"        Starting from Gallitzin State Park, the Lost Turkey Trail is a 26-mile trail that brings hikers through State Game Lands and into Blue Knob State Park. 

The first 13 miles of the trail are the easiest as they travel through Gallitzin State Forest along a mountain ridge bookended by rolling, mildly technical terrain. With several long, steady uphills, these miles act as a preamble to the second half, which is up and down many different peaks and crosses several wider streams. 

At mile 24 (along Hog Back Ridge) there is a monument built to two children who got lost in the mountains and perished in 1856.  The last three miles are a 1,400-foot challenge up strap inclines when your legs are their weakest. The trail ends at Herman Point in Blue Knob State Park. The views from the end are amazing, hopefully you have enough energy to enjoy them!

4.6,Loop,418,230,491,493,4,19,White Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Ridley Park is a beautiful park with a variety of trails to follow. This trail is clearly marked with white blazes, and will allow you to enjoy rolling hills and some time near a beautiful creek.

Follow the singletrack dirt path through rolling wooded hills. The path often passes by large boulders, creeks, and other interesting features to keep you interested. This path does have a number of road crossings, so you don't always get a full immersion in nature, but some of them have been mitigated by small overpasses or other features that make them feel safe.

The several water crossings have well-maintained bridges to keep hikers high and dry.

11.9,Point to Point,1897,1461,1126,1078,4,14,Hickory Creek Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,4.0,"        Hickory Creek Trail is the only designated trail in the Hickory Creek Wilderness. This is a foot travel only trail. The loop is 12 miles long traversing over flat to moderately steep terrain. 

There is only one trailhead located at the Hickory Creek parking area and the trail is marked with yellow or white blazes painted on trees. The markings are infrequent and often faded, so keep an eye out. Additionally, the trail is only maintained to primitive standards, which results in a lot of vegetation encroachment on the trail along with many fallen trees across the trail.

This trail offers challenges to a wide range of skill levels as it traverses the rolling terrain within the Hickory Creek Wilderness. Fishing for small native brookies can be done in East and Middle Hickory Creeks. These trails are open for winter hiking. Remember to dress in layers appropriate for the weather conditions and be aware that these trails are used heavily in the late fall and spring by hunters. It is a good idea to wear bright fluorescent colored clothing if hiking during these time periods.

The easiest way to access this trail is at the tree line, but this little connector is not blazed to the Blue loop, and is a quick up and down. You'll come to a ""T"" once at the Blue Loop. Make the right and start down the Blue Loop. Not long after, the Blue Loop emerges from the woods in a small field. From here you'll have to cross a road, pass the Tomahawk shelter, and head over a parking lot (this is the road crossing). 

The trail can be a little tricky to find, but there are blue blazes in this open area, and the trail fully reappears along the tree line. Stay straight down the steep drop. (Note: An unmarked side trail juts off to the right. There are plenty of un-blazed trails in Settler's Cabin)

The popular trail follows Hell Run, a six-foot wide stream that meanders through the hollow.  The trail is also about six feet wide and remains relatively flat.  The waterfall at the end is an amazing payoff for such a short journey and there is also an old iron furnace right next to it you can explore.  

There are a couple bridges you'll have to cross along the way that you'll need to step onto and off of, and then at the end of the trail there is a 15ft staircase that takes you down to the actual waterfall.   This is an easy hike to enjoy with your family, but there are some obstacles for those with mobility problems.

In the summer it is shaded the entire length.  

The middle section of the trail parallels the melodious, cascading Roaring Run and crosses it 26 times. Water proof boots that go over the ankle will allow passage with dry feet, and it is possible to traverse the entire trail in the driest seasons resulting in only damp shoes. 

The area is a lush mixed eastern deciduous forest with laurel trees at lowest elevations along the stream, and the ground cover is dominated by ferns.  There are only a few, obscure features that indicate human activity other than the trail itself so the area does have a very natural appearance. The trail was well maintained with a only a few obstructions/fallen trees across the trail and no areas were the trail is washed out (August 2018).

The region certainly lives up to its name, as Pine Creek has carved steep slopes from the Pennsylvania landscape over millennia.  Today, the gorge is a beautiful and scenic locale. 

A long logging history once stripped this beautiful area of the ancient hardwood and pine forests that had thrived for centuries, though more recent protections from the National Parks Service and the Pennsylvania State Forest Service have made a great impact on the damage of the area. Today, 100-year-old trees and a variety of local fauna have returned to the gorge, providing for scenic company to any taking the rail trail. The recovery of the area is a testament to the resiliency of our natural world. 

The trail itself is well maintained, and is mostly composed of hard packed dirt or crushed limestone. While most visitors use one of two main trailheads, there are many access points on this trail, making it easy to plan an outing of almost any distance. For those seeking a longer outing, there are many places to camp along the trail and the scenery is amazing. You won't be disappointed by taking this great trail!

As is the case for North Country Trail, the blaze is bright blue. In general, the trail is well-groomed, but there are sections of loose rock and larger rocks that slow your pace.

The trail starts by taking you over Hidden River Bridge before crossing the bike path and N. Shore Drive. Once over the road, you start the first of many climbs. Continue following the blazes over several roads, around one small pond, and past the marina on your way to the end of this section at Route 528, near the bridge crossing over Lake Arthur.

Once you cross Route 528, you'll be presented with a 300-foot climb to the top of a ridge, which offers a nice view of Lake Arthur in fall and winter when the leaves have dropped. There are several stretches of open space as you climb which also give glimpses of the lake.

The next 5 miles are similar to the first 8. You'll make 3 climbs along singletrack trail which is primarily smooth with occasional sections of loose rock.

You'll recognize the end of the trail when you reach the Jennings Environmental Center and a uphill slope of flower beds. The end of the Glacier Ridge Trail does not mark the end of the North Country Trail, which continues on to Allegheny National Forest, and all the way to the New England states.

14.8,Point to Point,1151,842,429,582,1,16,West Penn Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        The West Penn Trail is officially recognized as a National Recreation Trail and is a beautiful, accessible route for anyone in the area. The trail stretches between Saltsburg to just outside Blairsville along the path of the old Portage Railroad line that ran from 1830 to 1864. 

This line was originally built to connect Pittsburgh and Harrisburg. The trail is still under development in an effort to extend it further along the railroad path. For updated conditions and route information, check the Conemaugh Valley Conservancy website.

The trail is comprised of five sections. The first is at Conemaugh River Lake, near the Conemaugh Dam, where the trail heads across four stone arch bridges that date back to the early 1900s.

The second section is the Bow Ridge Switchback to Conemaugh Dam Section. Here, the trail passes two tunnels and a hydroelectric plant with some elevation that can be a great, aerobic challenge for riders.

The third section is the Dick Mayer section that follows the former railroad bed and has some challenging crushed gravel and rough, wooded singletrack. 

The penultimate section is Saltsburg and this stretch of the trail goes along the banks of the Conemaugh River for just over four miles, heading through shaded woodlands. Be aware as horseback riding and biking are permitted.

The final section is the Kiski Extension, which follows the east riverbank for 1.5 miles until it comes to an open field. Beyond the field, the trail heads onto private property.

4.6,Loop,2752,1852,903,904,7,22,North Loop Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        Accessible from McKenna Trail and Painter Rock Trail (via a connector), the North Loop Trail is a rugged 5 mile loop with 1000 feet of climbing. There are three elements to this trail: jaggers, rocks/boulders, runs.  Going counterclockwise, the trail begins with a gentle descent, before turning straight down the mountainside at ~15-20% for a quarter mile, and then easing up again. The beginning section of trail, at roughly 2800 feet, is covered in knee-high grasses, similar to McKenna Trail. As you descend the trail, the grasses thin and vanish, before around 2200 feet, jaggers (briars) appear and thicken. This makes the trail a bit tougher to hike because the jaggers are large enough to cut up your legs. You may note a run crossing that cuts the trail diagonally. You'll cross this run later, when it is much larger and rushing downhill.

Around the first mile, the trail takes a significant turn left (south), but there appears to be other options.  Follow the yellow blazes. Very shortly after this turn, the trail makes another hard right, which is miss-able.  Small logs and sticks are dragged across the trail to mark the turn. If you stay straight the trail becomes noticeably less ""maintained"" and you'll not see any yellow blazes.

It is very shortly after these series of turns that you'll come to a brief section with boulders on either side of the trail and look like monuments. It's a nice reprieve from the jaggers and monotony of the trail.  

Once at the bottom of the mountain, the trail slowly begins rising. You'll cross two streams at this point. The first stream you'll have crossed earlier, and has grown as it picks up more water. The other stream originates within the loop. Roaring Run Natural Area contains several natural springs. Note the clarity of the water.

The final big turn marks the start of the 1000 foot climb. Unlike the descent, it is less steep and can be hike in many of the sections. There is a connector trail to take you to Painter Rock Trail about mid-way up the climb.

You'll arrive back at the loop start with McKenna Trail to the right.

1.4,Point to Point,1650,1436,194,215,5,10,Penny Run Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        Both trailheads are found along the park road. The northern trailhead is tucked under trees with a small wooden bridge marking the entrance. The southern trailhead has a metal gate and looks like a fire access road. Once on the trail, it quickly turns to doubletrack mixed with singletrack. The trail has lots of smaller rocks and roots, but nothing notable.  

Starting at the southern trailhead, hikers climb the entire way to the 90-degree turn in the trail. The climb is gentle and the trail is smooth enough to make it very manageable. The turn marks the end of significant climbs; although there is a slight uphill, it is insignificant. Hikers will be able to see out ahead since the trail is so straight in this section and the tree canopy is high. At the end of the straight-away, hikers make another 90-degree turn, this time heading back down the hill paralleling Penny Run.

Once out of the woods, hikers can head to the campgrounds for the Nature Trail or Lowlands Trail or head towards the park office for some rugged singletrack on the north side of the lake (Adams Run, Orchard Trail, and Hunters Ridge).

The trail is well-kept and begins along the lake where you can enjoy waterfowl and other types of birds.   There are several nesting boxes along the way as well. 

This trail has both a short and long loop. About 1/4 mile in you bump into the only significant incline but it can be a doozy for new hikers or the elderly.  

After the climb into the hillside, the scenery is close with no real vistas.   There are some great stands of pines that are definitely worth experiencing though.  

This is a loop trail and will return you to the parking area.

***IMPORTANT***  This trail is supposed to be marked with PINK blazes according to the state park map.  However, it has been remarked with DARK BLUE blazes.   The trail also appears to have undergone some redesigning.  There are some intersecting paths and offshoots but the blue blazes are easy to follow and well-marked.

While similar in name, this trail is NOT the Schuylkill River Trail - Pawlings to Lock 60.

From the trailhead, follow the crushed gravel path down river 3 miles.  Along the way, you'll find several views of the Schuylkill River to your right.  You'll pass the site of Sullivan's Bridge, part of the Valley Forge encampment, where George Washington's Army took shelter during the winter of 1777-1778.  

At the beginning of the trail, a large earthen mound is to your left.  This is the impoundment for the Walnut Hill Desilting Basin, an additional trail is available on top of the berm. In other sections of the trail, multiple wetlands areas are present on your left. In the winter, expect to find ducks and geese.  In Spring look for frogs and salamanders.

The best view on this trail is right at the start, at the junction with the Blue Dot Trail—hike south down the ridge about 50 feet to a rock outcropping. 

From the start, the trail heads northeast, paralleling the Appalachian Trail. As a reasonably level old road through the woods, it is a well defined path, but can be narrow at times.

About halfway along the trail, you'll see an open field which is the site of a Heliport used by the fire service. After about 3.0 miles, the road intersects with the Turquoise Trail which cuts through a valley and past Sunfish Pond to connect with the AT. Currently the trail is crossed with down logs at the intersection with the Turquoise Trail (though they may not remain), so be on the lookout for the Turquoise Trail intersection. The Mt. Tammany Fire Road continues to the Yards Creek Reservoir which is private property. If you continue past the Turquoise Trail, you'll have to turn around at the boundary and retrace your steps.

Primary access is via the dirt fire road road on the south side of Knowlton Rd, and the road narrows to doubletrack. Look for the trail to branch off to the right to follow the route - you'll end up back on the doubletrack at the end of the hike. 

There is an alternative connector signed for access to the Figure 8 Trail off Knowleton Rd, on MTB Project as  Figure 8 Trail - Knowleton Road Connector, which is a good exit, but not a great entrance to the trail due to steep grade uphill from Knowleton Rd to the Figure 8 Trail. 

You'll encounter a section where the trails cross at a 4-way intersection, thus the name, Figure 8. Just proceed straight through the intersection, and you'll eventually loop around and come back through. This applies no matter whether you're going clockwise or counterclockwise.

As it continues the passive management of the forest almost makes it feel as though you are entering into the forest moon of Endor.  

As it climbs it passes junctions with various other trails through this area. Once the trail levels off these are some wonderful opportunities to view the treetops of the enormous trees. The trail then turns to the left and drops steeply. Here, there are exceptional views as the grade of the trail allows you to see full trees right in front of you. 

Eventually, the trail flattens out and turns to the right. The rest of the trail is a slight and scenic descent. On the right, as the trail nears its terminus, there are both a memorial fountain and a plaque designating this area a National Natural Landmark. The trail then ends in the parking lot for the Log Cabin Inn Environmental Education Center.

Low grades and a flowing trail with small obstacles (mostly roots) make this a simple hike through a uniquely fern-filled and green section of forest, especially in the summer.

This trail is easily accessed from the Middle Road parking area. Proceed east across the open gravel lot and follow the gravel road approximately 100 meters until the trail appears on your left, entering the woods just above the small stream crossing (one step and you're over it).

We call Ranger our bellwether trail because it gives a pretty indication of how the rest of the system is holding up. If Ranger is sloppy then turn around and head home because the rest of the trails are likely just as bad. If most of Ranger is in good shape then you're probably good to go!

This section starts out tight and twisty along a ridge that used to form a small pond. At the midpoint of the trail, there is an old concrete Horse Trough on the downhill side of the trail. From here, the trail gets less winding and eventually ends in a clear cut area before joining Lower Riverview Trail.

Over 3 miles of up and down, this trail rolls nicely through an old junkyard, house foundation, and Nikks Big Banana.  When people hike this, they might get to the bottom and say, ""Man I cant wait to do this entire trail again!""

Kitchen Sink starts off of Up & Out Loop. Hang a right and head up the side of the mountain. It looks horrible, but once you get to the top the trail is rolling all the way to the 3D climb.  Climb that and youll be on your way to some really easy well-maintained trails. Be sure to enjoy the wildlife while youre up there. You'll encounter deer and squirrels, so make sure youre paying attention. Continue onwards and youll end up at the Old Access Road. From there, climb to the top of the Access Road, and make sure you play around on the old House Foundation.  

After the foundation, youll hit some really easy trail until you get to the old junkyard. Watch your step; youre in an old junkyard. From here you'll have two more small, but lung busting climbs before you hit the final descent.  Slog up those two and youre almost home-free. Once you're at the bottom, you'll meet up with the Up & Out Loop. Hike that back to the parking area!

11.4,Point to Point,177,2,515,682,2,11,Pennypack Trail - Philadelphia County,Intermediate,3.8,"        The Pennypack Trail begins in Huntingdon Valley in Montgomery County and continues south through wooded Lorimer Park and on into Philadelphia County. A portion follows the former Fox Chase-Newton Branch line. 

A highlight of the pathway is its passage through Pennypack Park, one of Philadelphia’s most beloved parks, which offers several miles of unpaved trails for mountain bikers and equestrians. From the park, the rail-trail offers a paved route all the way to the waterfront of the Delaware River. Along the way, you’ll follow Pennypack Creek through rolling hills and curves.

In 2015, the trail was extended to the communities of Bryn Athyn, Rockledge, Lower Moreland, and Upper Moreland. It continues along Pennypack Creek (including a 143-foot bridge over the scenic waterway) and now totals just over 14 miles.

With over 14 parking areas variably spaced along the route, the McDade Recreational Trail provides all users with an appropriate length of trail. Parking areas can be as close as half a mile, and as far as five miles apart.

For those wishing to travel along the trail one-way, the National Park Service funds a free weekend bus service that stops at many major trailheads along the route. To view the schedule, click here.

Be aware that there are no services along the route, so be sure to bring all the food and water you'll need along with you. 

While the terrain is variable along the trail, each section exhibits a distinct nature: some are flat ribbons of gravel along the river, while others climb up the valley walls, and some are in between. 

Regardless of the section traveled, visitors to the McDade Recreational Trail are bound to have a wonderful and enriching experience along the banks of the Delaware.

Trail Segments are described below: 

From Hialeah Trailhead to Owens Trailhead, the trail traverses gently graded pastoral farmlands, complete with paint-peeling fences and rustic out-buildings.From Owens Trailhead to the park headquarters, the trail leaves the river's flood plane and climbs steeply up the valley walls through densely forested switchback turns.From the park headquarters to Bushkill Access, visitors will wander along rolling terrain, while keeping eyes peeled for the crumbling foundations of buildings constructed in a bygone era.From Bushkill Access to Milford Beach, the trail skirts the Delaware on a thin slice of land before leveling out near Schneider Farm, where it continues along gentle grades to Milford Beach.

9.4,Point to Point,2743,1883,1377,1448,6,21,Whitetail Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        One of the most notable trails in western Pennsylvania due to its length and combination of challenging ascents, fun descents and ""deep in the forest"" feel. The trail actually parallels Skyline road along the ridge top, so the remote feeling is a bit of an illusion.  There is also a not-to-be-missed view point just before the final descent to the Lick Hollow Picnic area.

There are multiple options for how to set it up as a loop hike. One option is Quebec Odyssey which uses road hiking for the return.  

Whitetail starts at the North parking area of the Quebec Run area, which also has trailheads for Hess Trail and Miller Trail. The first real stream crossing is at Long Run, where the Long Run trail goes off to the right. Instead cross the stream continuing with a long climb up the other side. As it tops out, there will be a short descent then a pipeline cut crossing. After awhile, the trail crosses Skyline road where you'll pass a parking area that could be used for shuttles. After the road crossing, the trail is exceptionally fun as it twists and turns through trees, roots and rocks. The next notable feature is the descent to Redstone creek, where you end up on an old logging road. At this point look for the singletrack down to the creek crossing (don't hike down the road). 

After crossing the creek, there will be some climbing before you arrive at a doubletrack which you need to descend on for awhile. Continue on with the descent following the blazes alongside and looking for the point where the singletrack continues off to the right. Shortly thereafter you'll arrive at the junction with Pine Knob Trail. Just before the final descent to the right on Pine Knob trail, take the left to check out the Pine Knob overlook. Then return to the descent to Lick Hollow Picnic area. This descent is challenging fun. The Lick Hollow Picnic area is nicely situated with ample parking and toilets.

4.7,Point to Point,1575,970,133,707,3,14,Raccoon Run Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        The biggest difficulty was finding the trail. The easiest access point to this 4.7 mile section is from the southern terminus. There is parking on the north side of the road, just after turning past Snowy Mountain Rd, while staying on 233. Look for a sign on the north side of the road (about 200 after right turn) with directions to the AT and Raccoon Run Trail. The trees are marked with blue blazes. 

The trail begins with a slightly rocky start before crossing over to the east side of 233, where it remains for this entire section. After crossing 233, expect another crossing over the Rocky Mountain Creek. The bridge is in good condition and did not show any signs of aging. A quick left turn after the bridge, and you'll begin the main leg of the trail moving northward, following 233. 

The trail has some slight gains and losses of elevation with nothing more than 3-5% for the first few miles. This is a great warm up section if you plan on hiking the length of the trail and back. We did this trail on February 13 and conditions here were sometimes not ideal. Certain areas were a little flooded (no higher than the ankle) due to snowmelt. 

After crossing one logging road, a second road crossing is needed. The trail picks up on other corner of the bridge. The last mile of the trail was the most difficult. There can be icy conditions due to being on the shaded side of the mountain among lots of evergreen trees. Here, hikers will encounter the biggest changes in elevation.

It is about 6 miles to Cowan's Gap State Park, where you can catch a shower, go for a swim, relax on the sandy beach, refill water bottles, and eat a meal at the concession. Immediately exiting the parking lot headed south, the trail crosses the road and climbs about 600 feet.  

It is roughly 5 miles to the The Big Mountain Shelter, which again appears relatively clean and rarely used. The fire pit is surrounded by large stones skillfully arranged like furniture and a spring fills a small pond about 200 yards to the south. About 0.75 miles uphill is the Big Mountain overlook, which is a spectacular site to catch a sunrise or gaze at the stars.

Look for a sign post for Astronomy Trail to the right of the grassy area. There are occasional red blazes. 

From here, the trail remains fairly level on hard packed soil, passing through open woodland with acres of blueberry bushes and mountain laurel. The trail becomes narrow in places from the overgrowth. At 1.5-miles, the trail begin a rocky descent to Milesburn Road within sight of Baltimore Rd.

There is a nice pavilion at the east end of the trail for picnics. Shortly after the start of the trail, you'll see a small waterfall on Meeks Run. There are two small creek crossings along the trail where you'll need to hop across rocks. Having waterproof shoes and a walking stick can be helpful. 

If you start at Hassam Road, you'll take a Connector Trail, which will end up taking you through a wetland on top of a boardwalk.

This trail is blazed blue, but not well, though it's not hard to follow the trail without the blazes. 

You can pick up other trails in the conservation area such as the Powerline Trail, Oil Well Trail, Cave Trail, and the Honeydew Trail.

47.9,Loop,2327,1081,7771,7737,6,27,Chuck Keiper Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        The Chuck Keiper Trail is a 50 mile backpacking trail in the remote Pennsylvania Wilds.  The trail can be done as one larger 50 mile loop or use the East Branch trail to create a 31 mile or 24 mile option. Starting from the main parking area on Rt. 144, across from swamp branch rd., hike the trail in a counterclockwise direction.  

The first couple of miles start off pretty mellow before dropping down into the first big decent into the Fish Dam Wild Area.  Hike to the stream and then climb out via a short, steep climb.  Next you'll drop down into the Burns Run Wild Area.  This is a long decent to the stream with a long and steep ascent out of the wild area.  Next, the trail leads to the Yost Run area.  It is a long, gradual ascent out of Yost Run.  You'll be rewarded with a series of waterfalls toward the end of Yost Run.  Cross Rt. 144 at an alternate trailhead parking area and then begin a decent into the Eddy Lick area.  You'll meander along Eddy Lick and come across several remnants of the old logging era.  

After Eddy Lick enjoy a long stretch of  moderate terrain that mostly follows old logging roads.  At approximately mile 28 the Chuck Keiper intersects the East Branch Trail.  You can take this trail to cut the larger loop in half.  Continue hiking the rolling terrain to the Cranberry Swamp area.  Take the loop around Cranberry Swamp or bypass if you want to cut some mileage.  Next head into a smaller drainage with a moderate climb to Mill Run Rd.  After crossing Mill Run, drop into the steeper Boggs Run area. Hike along Boggs Run for sever miles before climbing out and coming to a vista once you cross Peters Run Rd.  

Next drop into another drainage and cross Rt. 144 again.  Descend into the final drainage of the hike and follow the stream for a while before climbing out to join Barneys Ridge Rd.  Take a short side trip to Big Rocks Vista.  After a little road hiking, veer to the right and back to the parking lot. Finish with the great vista from the parking lot.  PA DCNR provides a good trail map or there is a detail trail guide by Dave Gantz.

1.4,Point to Point,1090,952,158,245,5,15,Camp Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        This trail can be accessed from the dam parking lot or from Buckskin Trail. From Buckskin Trail, the Camp Trail falls down the hillside to cross over a small creek with an immediate jump up the opposite hillside. Here, you'll find a pair of stone structures. The trail juts right and continues along the hillside all the way to the dam before crossing a park road and finishing up at the dam parking lot.

While hiking along the hillside, you'll have plenty of opportunity to look out over the valley floor and the creek that winds its way through. While only a 100 feet up, it's a great section that takes your mind away from hiking.

10.8,Point to Point,662,536,164,54,0,1,Cumberland Valley Rail Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        This crusher fine rail trail takes hikers from Newville to Shippensburg and vice-versa. If you're looking for a mellow out-and-back hike, look no further than the CVRT.

Though this trail is buffered by trees in some areas, you'll have expansive views of South Mountain and Blue Mountain for nearly this trail's entirety. The folds of the surrounding Appalachian topography are very apparent from this vantage.

In addition to these Appalachian mountains, you'll note that almost every property this trail rolls through is a farm. This valley is so filled with farms because of its flat topography, access to water, and its limestone-rich geology.

Soils formed from limestone-rich rock is subsequently rich in calcium carbonate. This soil component improves the nutrient uptake of plants by increasing the pH of the soil. This also affects water penetration of the soil and provides plants with calcium and magnesium.

You park at the highest point of the trail. Then it is an easy descent until you reach a campsite. There is one turn on the left side of the trail that you can take to extend your hike, but otherwise this is just an easy 1.2-mile trail out to a campsite.

The campsite offers a fire pit and a good viewpoint through the trees.

There are several small singletrack sections that branch off of this trail which can be tied together.  A good start is Homewood Trail to Hawthorne Trail Connector to the Hawthorne Trail to the Undercliff Road Connector to Undercliff Road to Undercliff Trail to Forbes Ave. Use caution with Forbes Ave Crossing and take Forbes ave to Biddle / Braddock Trail connector to access the tennis courts and more trails along the eastern ridge branching off the Braddock Trail.

0.8,Point to Point,1221,1182,2,40,1,6,Toms Run Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        This is a nice and easy trail through old-growth forest that parallels Toms Run. Throughout the trail, it crosses several bridges. However, the first bridge (at the time of writing) is closed because of structural issues and, thus, requires a mildly tricky crossing via stepping stones. It continues along the run and gives views of both old-growth trees and a landscape that has been very passively managed. The trail is well maintained, but is not, in fact, marked. The terminus of the trail is across a swing bridge that traverses the run. This is a nice and somewhat hidden feature that is fun for the whole family.

Is a great way to get to Tram Rd. from Smays Run Trail instead of using the forest roads.

0.4,Point to Point,492,247,0,245,12,27,Jaws,Very Difficult,4.0,"        Jaws is one of the more difficult trails on Spring Mountain. It begins by going down the backside of the mountain on part of the Backside DH trail. 

It then veers off right down a series of very steep, rocky shoots separated by technical rock gardens to a section of singletrack before intersecting the Perkiomen Trail. Take the Perkiomen Trail back to the lower parking lot of Spring Mountain.

3.8,Point to Point,504,444,155,165,2,9,Angler's Access Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        This trail is a multi-use trail. Didn't see too many people walking the trail when I went. The trail is a loop that can be travelled in either direction. One direction will give you smooth uphills and trickier downhills while the other direction gives you trickier climbs and smooth downhills. 

The technical climbs are somewhat steep with large roots making the footing difficult. There are also wooden bridges to cross along the trail. 

The trail has two areas that lead you to the main road for a brief period and then puts you back onto the actual trail again. The trail is marked with blue paint or wooden signs with a blue mark.  

There are a few logs as well, but these have a little dirt ramp to make getting over a little easier. About a quarter-mile of the trail is on the park side, which is open area with gravel for the trail. There are pavilions and bathrooms as well.

1.7,Point to Point,1608,1525,30,99,1,4,Laurel Run Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        This trail begins at the boardwalk at the south end of Parker Lake. As it follows the boardwalk it zigzags over a shallow marsh. While it is bowed and in need of small repairs, it is a nice place to hike. Here is an opportunity to view the various wildlife alive in the lake including salamanders and small fish.  

After leaving the boardwalk, the trail transitions into a nice dirt path along the lake. When I did this trail, as we made this transition a bald eagle leaped from the branches above us and soared over the lake.  As it continues, there is a pine grove where the path widens to include a small group of rock formations. As the trail curves at the north end of the lake, it passes rocks that have been laid out to spell ""Parker Dam"" on the ground.

The trail then continues over the berm of the mostly earthen, CCC-era dam. To the right, just in the lake is a structure that supports a bat box.  Next, the trail comes to the part of the dam over which Laurel Run flows. This part of the dam is fairly ingenious as instead of a traditional bridge, a large area of steppingstones has been placed to accommodate for the movement of both visitors and the stream. The trail crosses these stones and climbs up stairs on the other side of the dam.

After the dam, the trail ventures into a more wooded section of the park.  This is the first time where the yellow blazes that mark the trail are both visible and necessary. The rest of the trail continues fairly flat and near the river, though there are some places that are overgrown and muddy.  This is a generally pleasant second half of the trail. The terminus of the trail is the bridge that crosses over Laurel Run.
    ",PA
0.5,Point to Point,1675,1199,0,475,18,32,Big Hill Trail,Very Difficult,4.0,"        This trail isn't well marked, so you'll have to work a little bit to get to the start. Start at the top of Woodrow Road and turn east. After about 100 yards, there will will be an open section with a doubletrack to the right and a trail into the woods on the left. Head up the doubletrack a little ways and the start of the downhill will be (somewhere) on your right. Make sure to use the Hiking Project mobile app to help find the way.

The trail starts out with the hardest section first with a steep and rocky section where you'll want to watch your footing. After that, the trail doesn't flatten out, but it gets a bit easier until ending at the SWMA #8 Haul Road.

You'll see evidence of the routes that cyclists have been using, but use caution as these can be slick on foot. It's a great trail, with your fun only limited by your risk aversion (common sense?).

There is also a connector with a bridge over Quebec Run to cross back to the Mill Run Trail about half way. 

The trail features sustained climbing in the north to south direction. The loamy soil drains well in wet weather. Expect a few creek crossings from tributaries to Quebec Run.

1.9,Point to Point,2044,1304,742,2,8,15,Bear Run Trail,Intermediate,4.0,"        NOTE: Not to be confused with the Bear Run Nature Trail some miles west.

The trail starts across Landrus Road from a small parking area, which is notable for a plaque dedicated to the former Village of Landrus. (A connecting path north of the road leads to MST - Section 18.) The first 50 feet or so of the trail is wide enough for a car, and this width continues on a small spur to the right (west), where there is a small clearing with a fire pit. 

After the spur, the trail is singletrack and sparsely marked with very faded red blazes.Terrain is generally fairly rocky. The trail runs uphill in the Bear Run valley, passing a couple of waterfalls. Just under 1 mile from the road, the trail actually crosses Bear Run twice, which might cut your hike short depending on how much rain the area has received recently. Eventually, the trail separates from Bear Run and continues through woods, and becomes less steep. The trail terminates on the top of Hickory Ridge, where the Long Run Railroad Trail meets Bloss Mountain Road.

You'll hear buzzing coming from the Model Airplane Airport nearby and wonder if it's someone running a chainsaw in the distance.

These are less maintained than some of the other trails here, and may be hard to traverse in the heavy growth months.  Wear some pants and gloves, because the Jaggers will get you.

1.3,Point to Point,227,168,84,69,2,6,Pickering Ice Dam Trail,Easy/Intermediate,4.0,"        The Pickering Creek Dam Trail has some historical significance, as back in the 1900's they would dam up the area in the winter in order to collect ice which would be shipped to Philadelphia. The trail is relatively flat, and obstacle free, with an old bridge in the middle to get across the creek. 

There is a second trail that runs along the top of the ridge, once you cross the bridge near Bird Ln. The upper trail runs parallel to a housing development, and the trail to get there is fairly steep. One section even has a rope to help you get up over a small ridge, which can be a big icy/slippery during the winter months. Expect to see dog-walkers, nature photographers, and trout fisherman along the trail.

2.0,Point to Point,2922,2798,137,157,3,11,Airport Island,Difficult,4.0,"        One way to start this trail is to park at the resort and hike past the lake and then onto Tahoe Drive where the trail becomes obvious on the side of Tahoe Drive. Another way is to come up the 24 hour race climb and turn right at the top onto the singletrack just before you reach Airport Road.

As shown, the trail parallels Airport Road and goes onto the ""island"" section, which has a few interesting boulders to navigate. 

From the start, the trail mostly follows the contour with short bits of ascending and descending. Eventually, you'll come out on a doubletrack. Cross it to stay on the singletrack. 

This is the ""island"" part, stay to your left at the first junction and the trail will wrap around bringing you back out to the doubletrack. Here, if you again cross the road, you can hike a very short singletrack extension that brings you back to the road again. Turn right and head out to the end of the old runway avoiding some large puddles. 

At the end, you gain access to the Big Fern Loop, which is a loop trail that goes out to Dumbauld Road and back. You'll likely hear target practice in this area.

Named for the moss phlox that blooms each April, Pink Hill is a serpentine barren: an ecosystem with an underlying bedrock with high levels of toxic nickel and an imbalance of magnesium and calcium.

This trail departs from the Scenic Loop. It is marked by a small sign that you must be looking for, but also by a pink bench (far easier to see). Follow the grass path through ""Gate 7"", making sure to close the gate behind yourself. After crossing Painter Road, this trail will give a glimpse into several ecosystems. Enjoy several water crossings, moderate climbs, and a nice tour of the natural world.

3.1,Point to Point,1812,1517,293,412,4,19,Black Gap Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        Black Gap Trail is one of the ""must do"" trails in the area. It's broken roughly into thirds and is often referred to as West, Middle and East sections by locals. The Middle section is wet for much of the year and might be worth skipping, unless you really want a challenge. And by wet, I don't mean muddy. The entire trail follows a drainage for a couple of vernal pools in the middle section and if there has been any rain, the middle section is more of a creek than a trail. It's all stone though, so it's pretty much only yourself that you're hurting. 

The preferred direction is from west to east. The trail starts off climbing up from Engle Road through a hemlock grove and is pretty open. Soon though the trail becomes a tunnel though rhododendron and mountain laurel, making for a very cool hike. This continues for about a mile until it intersects with the Handicapped Access Trail (referred to by locals by its original name, Jamboree Trail.) If you want to skip the middle section, go right and take the doubletrack for over a mile. 
The eastern third was re-routed in 2011 and has some rocky bits before dropping into the creek bed to finish out the trail. Be careful crossing the bridges as they can be slick.

The trail is narrow singletrack, and may be overgrown at times. While there is one descent followed by a climb, the grades are moderate, and most will be able to tackle these features with ease. The main entrance to the trail is to the left at the entry way at Old Frankstown Road and exits onto the sidewalk near the lower parking loop for the Wave Pool.  

A good way to connect this trail is to follow the White Blaze Blue Dot trail from the log cabin to the Orange Blaze White Dot trail and cross Old Frankstown Road to the main trail entrance. 

After you exit the Wave Pool Trail, then follow the road back towards Old Frankstown Road and look for a clearing on the left towards the skate park and there will be a small un-blazed connector trail, Wave Pool Trail Connector, which will take you down to the corner of Cooper Road and Old Frankstown Road.

There are many small connectors between this and the White Blaze, Outer Trail - Gravel Road, and White Blaze Blue Dot trails. You'll also find a shortcut to the Blue Blaze Red Dot and Blue Blaze Black Dot loop.

It may appear confusing on the map as it runs parallel with, but it doesn't overlap, the White Blaze trail for a short period with a few small connecting paths between.

If you come back this way, this is a good spot to dip your feet in to cool down! The trail gets steep pretty much right away and doesn't really relent until you've reached Baker Trail at the top.

Rock-n-Ridge Trail #4 is mostly used downhill. It is debated whether this or Crist Ridge Trail is the best downhill cross country trail in the Blue Knob State Park. From the intersection with Sawmill, the trail starts as a fast doubletrack downhill. The first portion is a grassy slope.

3.3,Point to Point,2065,1898,213,114,2,8,Frank Gantz Trail,Difficult,4.0,"        The Frank Gantz Trail is rated moderately difficult for hiking, so trail running is quite challenging due to the rocky terrain. If the ground is wet, the rocks can be extremely slippery and running would not be wise. 

The trail connects with the Lakeside Trail around Tobyhanna, which is an easy five-mile loop, and therefore the two trails can be coupled together for an ~11-mile run departing and returning to Gouldsboro State Park.

The way is marked by yellow or golden color trail I.D. blazes. Some of the blazes have faded a little in the southern section of the trail, so keep an eye out. The northernmost part of this trail does offer a loop section from the north trailhead, and this portion has golden with white blazes, distinguishing it is a loop trail.

Here is the only ""tricky"" part. You'll see two roads: one with a brick structure splitting the lanes, and another that is cinder with a metal gate across it. Take the metal gate road; there are signs that indicate it is the Lockhart Trail (aka dog walking path). You'll head down the fire road for a hundred feet or so before a sign (on your right) will indicate the trail turns left off the road, down a few stone steps.  Continue on the trail from here.

In general, the trail is really nice and as you make your way around the loop, you'll come to a stretch of large stone steps which are unique. A section of the trail follows along the hillside with a great view in the fall with colors from the trees across the valley and above Squaw Run.

From Cucumber Falls, the trail starts with rocky terrain at the base of the falls, and then follows along the Yough riverfront for approximately a quarter mile. There are chances to stop and enjoy watching rafters make their way around Fern Cliff.

At the mouth of Meadow Run, the trail turns to follow along the stream for a half mile. Here the trail forks, creating the lollipop. Taking the trail to the right will begin the climb to the top of the hill immediately. Taking the trail to the left will follow at the foot of the hill before making the climb. The climb itself is steep and rocky.

The return trip offers another glimpse of rafters on the Yough. The trail doesn't access other trails aside from Great Gorge Trail.

There are two distinct sections to this loop: The upper section and the valley section. The upper section is standard dirt singletrack that's well blazed, and well-groomed. The valley section starts and ends with a steep descent and climb. When in the valley itself, the trail becomes more difficult with fallen trees, debris, and multiple stream crossings.  However at the northern end of this trail section you'll be treated by a small waterfall.

2.7,Point to Point,846,699,202,302,4,12,Trail #15,Intermediate,3.8,"        Trail #15 is long and rocky, so just watch your footing. This trail was originally built by mountain bikers, so at no point along this trail is there any need to climb over large rocks. During the last ice age, PA was the terminus of the ice sheet and this is one of the more southern trails that showcases that geologic feature. There are numerous areas of very large boulders seemingly placed there by the hands of the gods. There are also multiple dead end spur trails that lead to rock climbing areas.

3.8,Point to Point,2734,2449,300,433,4,8,Fish Run Trail,Difficult,3.8,"        Fish Run Trail starts at the main parking lot of the Wolf Rock trailhead. The first section of trail was built by LHORBA. There is a fun mix of challenging rocky sections gardens and smooth singletrack until the trail makes a left at a T and follows an old service road. This section has grown into a smooth singletrack. 

A few hundred yards before Linn Run Road, the trail will make a 90 degree right and twist and turn until it meets up with the original part of Fish Run. There is a bailout point here on your left where Hickory Flats Rd meets Linn Run Rd. To take the bailout would be a mistake since you would miss arguably the best trail at Laurel Highlands. This original section of Fish Run is level to downhill for about 1.75 miles. The narrow singletrack follows a scenic stream, the namesake of the trail, through rocks and gradual twists and turns on less technical sections. 

You'll pass Hobblebush Trail on your right before continuing the descent to Linn Run Rd. Please be very cautious on the short drop onto Linn Run Rd. The trail is very washed out, loose and steep and there may be cars traveling the road.

When you hit Linn Run Rd. you have the choice of making a left on the road to return to the Wolf Run parking lot to access Picnic Trail or Wolf Rocks Trail or, for a longer hike, cross the road and continue on Fish Run Trail. 

At the road crossing, another leg of the trail continues downhill along the far side of the road. This leg is the remains of the PW&S logging railroad, but is not used because it simply dead ends ahead. The trail to Grove Run stays to the left as a sweeping uphill curve which originally served as a runaway train ramp during those logging days prior to the Park. A couple other small spurs drop off to the right along the climb but these are not used either.

If you continue on the Fish Run Trail, be prepared for rocky sections on a much less traveled trail. The trail will eventually end at a T on Grove Run Trail. A left on Grove Run, a left on Quarry Rd, a left on Weaver Rd and a left on Hickory Flats road will lead you back to Linn Run Rd. just below the Wolf Rocks parking lot. The other option is to stay on Grove Run to Linn Run Campground.

0.8,Point to Point,316,103,222,91,8,22,Neal Thorpe Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        The Neal Thorpe Trail starts at Lock 60 Canal Park.  From the parking area, cross the foot bridge over the Canal and turn left/upriver as if you are on the Upper Schuylkill River Trail.  

Before the trail enters the treeline, a trail sign indicates the Neal Thorpe Trail to the right.  The trail is well established and follows a small gorge upstream.  There are a couple of stream crossings, but each time I have visited, there has been no trouble crossing because of low water or ice.  

Approximately 1/2 mile in, the trail reaches a small open space with a fire pit in it. After this point the trail takes a hard left and climbs up a steep hill with no switchbacks.  Once on top of the hill, the trail is difficult to distinguish from the many other animal and footpaths atop the ravines. Following the largest path (perhaps it's an old logging road) will lead visitors through the trees to the north for approx. 1/4 mile. At this point, the trail will reach an end.  

It has been reported that there is a small path in the narrow section between private houses and steep hillside that allows you to continue  further and rejoin the Upper Schuylkill River Trail farther upstream, but the icy conditions prevented me from searching out the other end.

1.5,Point to Point,401,121,213,369,7,23,Mount Joy Trail,Intermediate,3.7,"        This trail is part of the ""Mount Joy Trail"" cluster. This is the primary path over Mount Joy. The trail is a nice climb/descent with only a few rugged sections. That majority of the trail is crushed gravel surface and is wide enough for two people . The trail starts at the Knox Farm parking area off of Rt 252 in Valley Forge National Park. From the trailhead map in the parking lot, follow the paved Joseph Plumb Martin Trail Northeast until the unpaved Mount Joy Trail .42 miles up.   This switchback will take you on the east side of two soldier bunkhouses.  A path directly up the field on the west side of the bunks is a social trail that cuts the switchback.  Please follow the paved path and help prevent erosion along the unofficial path.

The trail then gradually climbs up through two high points on Mt. Joy, but does not summit them. If you're looking to reach the summit, there are side trails to the top where an observatory used to stand.   Along the way there are several places to look out into Valley Creek and onto the Valley Forge Farms section of the park.  In this section will be General Knox's Quarters (present during encampment), PC Knox Estate (highly modified since encampment), Lord Stirling's Quarters (Modified after encampment) and General LaFayette's Quarters (far to the South-Southwest on the far side of Valley Creek).  


The trail then descends into the valley in which George Washington's Headquarters is situated.  After hiking to the headquarter's end of the trail, add a small bypass look on the return trip by turning left on Mount Joy - East Side Alternate Route.  

A second connector trail, Mount Joy - Joseph Plumb Martin Trail Connector departs the Mount Joy Trail to the East to join up with Joseph Plumb Martin Trail near Artillery Park.

The third option used to be a side loop to an old observatory.  The observatory was removed many years ago and part of the trail has recently been abandoned.  The Mount Joy - Observatory Loop connector still summits Mount Joy, but there is no Observatory and no return loop.  This trail is less maintained, several large steps required at the Mt Joy end of the trail before entering an open field where the observatory had been.  Without the observatory there is no clear view past the trees.  The connector then heads Northeast towards Inner Line Drive and Joseph Plumb Martin Trail.  The original loop is no longer maintained and difficult to pick out.

Trail conditions vary with three distinct sections.  Intermediate overall, but with a smooth middle section and a very rocky far section.  All are relatively level with a gradual overall downhill to the overlook. 

This trail starts at the rear parking area of Laurel Summit State Park adjacent to Fish Run Trail. The first section from the trailhead starts with a short rocky stretch and then meanders over rounded embedded boulders through high laurel to the intersection with Spruce Flats/Hobblebush.  

The middle section from Spruce Flats Trail to the Rector-Eddie Road connector is smoother with a few isolated rocks and some optional log obstacles along the sides of the trail. The last section from the connector to the overlook is increasingly rocky but is manageable all the way back to the overlook.

23.5,Point to Point,187,56,225,291,0,4,Schuylkill River Trail - Conshohocken to Parkersford,Easy,3.7,"        The Schuylkill River Trail will cover approimately 130 miles of the Schuylkill River when completed.  At this point, there are several discontinuous sections available.  This section of the trail is from Conshohocken to Parkersford.  For most of the path, this is paved and 4-8 feet wide.  It typically follows the river, although at times it may track straighter than the river and stray from the river's edge.

This section begins in a commercial/industrial section of Conshohocken.  At the start there is easy access to food, beverage and parking.  Just downriver on the trail (to be mapped still), there is a brewery with trail access.

Going upstream from Conoshohocken, you'll pass a blend of urban suburban, and rural landscapes.  The trail will travel through the edge of Norristown, before entering into Valley Forge National Historical Park (A connector to the park is still under construction, although a temporary wooden walkway is available along the US 422 bridge at Betzwoood Access).

In Valley Forge, the trail is wooded.  If it weren't for paralleling US 422, it would be quiet and serene.  After the trail crosses the Perkiomen Creek, one switchback carries the trail down to stream level near the Confluence of the Perkiomen Creek and Schuylkill River.  The trail continues along the bank of the Schuylkill behind an Industrial area of Oaks before another wooded and  isolated stretch up to Reynold's dog park.

At the Dog Park and downriver end of the Schuylkill Canal, the trail takes a hard S turn around the end of the Schuylkill Canal and continues on the riverside/towpath of the Canal (to be more accurate, it's really a navigation, not a canal).  From here until the Route 29 bridge in Phoenixville the trail is mostly grass/crushed stone.  (There is an onroad option of the trail at this point)

At the Route 29 Bridge, the trail crosses the Schuylkill into Chester County, then follows a few road sections behind Bridge Street (filled with popular shopping and dining options).  A recently opened section of trail continues through the gentle slopes and rural areas of Chester County to the trailhead in Parkersford.  A large portion of the Chester County section is a crushed gravel surface.  At this time, the adjacent section of trail has yet to be completed

While you are getting this nice warm up in pay attention to the big hill to your left, that's the monster you'll soon be climbing. 

Once the gap trail turns into pavement start looking for a left hand trail with a large information board that you'll be turning into. The trail officially begins at the information board. Go past the ruins and when you come to the bridge crossing the creek bear left and continue up the hill. Once you locate the stone stairs you are now at the base of the ""witch"". And trust me this trail is a witch!

You'll now start switch backing up the hill, frankly I lost count of switchbacks after ten. However, the climb continues on beautiful trail, even if it is very challenging.  Pay attention to the blue diamonds with black arrows, they will guide you up the trail.

The views from the top cliff edge are excellent.

These points also denote the distinct ""heads"" of the trail. 

The southern half of the trail is rolling with a few climbs and descent that can be enjoyed. The northern half is a single hill of 400 feet that is made of loose rock (2"" diameter). However, Jonathan Run Trail is a beautiful trail crossing over Jonathan Run several times, which is a 10-15 foot wide stream over little depth.

Note: when exiting the woods heading south to north, you'll exit the woods to a campground road with the wood shelter to your left. Stay on the road, heading up the small incline. The Kentuck Trail juts off the road and immediately begins the descent to Jonathan Trail.

Nevertheless, it is a stunning stretch of singletrack notable for its beauty as it courses along Quebec/Mill Run. The trail runs along a camping area that provides an excellent place to eat and relax. 

Also, from Mill Run Trail you can access Miller Trail, Rankin Trail, Grist Mill Trail, Brocker Trail, and Tebolt Trail, so the options are many to extend your hike from here in creative ways. 

The trail has a couple of small stream crossings and several muddy sections all of which can usually be bypassed. Full disclosure, there are a few challenges as the trail briefly ascends the sidehill before dropping down again and then at its southern end it climbs steeply.

2.1,Point to Point,1351,1213,241,226,4,10,Pleasant Valley Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.7,"        This singletrack trail begins with a climb into the forest of Moraine State Park.   The trail is full of roots and small rocks in the opening section and several areas can be swampy if it has rained recently.  

After the opening wooded section you enter a field.  Those familiar with the park will recognize this as the sled riding hill.  This is a very difficult section to navigate as there are no blazes here at all to guide you.  If you look closely you can see where the path winds across the hillside.  If you can't, aim for the bird nesting boxes and keep them just to your right. 

Next, you'll come to a road.  You'll cross the road and continue along the trees away from the road, keeping the trees to your left.   At the crest of the hill, head straight across and you'll see where the path leads down into the trees again.   

This section of the trail offers a view of the lake through the trees during the winter and early spring months.  Further down, the trail you'll pass some cuts that open up the lake view.  

Another road crossing comes up when you get to the Bear Run boat launch area. Signs are present here to keep you on the path. Again, the section after you cross the road is usually muddy. 

After that, you'll come upon signs for the Hilltop Trail.   Stay straight on the path to continue on the Pleasant Valley Trail.  

After another quarter mile or so you'll begin to descend.  As you near the bottom, you'll reach a Y intersection.  The Y signifies the end of the Pleasant Valley Trail, but it connects with the Sunken Garden Trail at this point.   If you go right, you'll be on the Sunken Garden Trail - Long Loop and have a few more miles added to your journey.  Heading left will follow the Sunken Garden Trail back to your vehicle and an open restroom.   

*NOTE*  The Sunken Garden Trail is a loop trail with only one exit so either direction will have you arriving at the same point. 

Following the Sunken Garden Trail - Short Loop will take you past the Rangers Office at the beginning of the park and then down along the lake.  After yet another wet section, a bridge across a small stream takes you close to the lake before returning you to the parking lot just before the Pleasant Valley Trail.

The trails in Roaring Run Natural Area are ""raw"" in the sense that there is minimal maintenance for removing debris and the terrain takes on a similar persona. The trails are rough, full of softball-sized rock and small sticks and debris are plentiful across the trails.

Starting from the Route 31 trailhead parking lot, McKenna Trail starts at the southern end of the parking lot (furthest end from Route 31) following the treeline before entering the woods. Once in the woods, the trail winds its way over two smaller hills before encountering the first major intersection with Painter Rock Trail (note, there are two other trails that intersect McKenna, and they lead to Painter Rock Road trail). Trails are blazed and major intersections are marked with sign posts. To continue on McKenna, stay straight/right to climb the most significant rise on McKenna. At the top, hikers will begin to descend before hiking into North Loop Trail.

There is no mountain biking or horseback riding. Adding to the technical terrain and often steep climbs or descents, the trails are often empty giving hikers solitude, if that's the desire.

The trail starts out with a gentle downhill before leveling off for the remainder of the section prior to crossing Forward Ave.  This section follows closely to the Nine Mile Run, and is surrounded by forest and tall grasses, making it a heat and humidity collector in summer.

You'll come to a small parking lot at Forward Ave and will have to cross to continue.  You'll pass under the parkway, which is at the Squirrel Hill Tunnel for reference.

From here, the trail becomes more scenic, while remaining well groomed with a gravel base.  You'll be faced with slight climb and quarter mile of flat trail surrounded again by tall grasses.  Then comes the 'big dip' which drops down to Nine Mile Run and immediately back up, losing and gaining the same amount of elevation on either side.

Keep an eye out as you hike, as there are many access trails, trail crossings and even road crossings as you head north along the White Trail. There is a very steep hill (though it is short) about 1.8 miles along the trail (if you're heading north). 

At the junction with the Orange Trail about 2.6 miles in, the trail begins to climb to the higher elevations in this valley. Wissahickon Creek will be visible for the majority of the trail when the trees are not leafed out (late fall through early spring). Unlike the Orange Trail which is a singletrack trail, White Trail is wide enough to hike two abreast for the vast majority of its length. A special feature is the Statue of Tedyuscung at mile 4.1. The trail ends at another junction with the Orange Trail and the Laveder Trail. I highly recommend adding the Lavender Trail to your hike as it follows a babbling brook back down to the Orange Trail which is a delightful highlight.

8.2,Point to Point,930,895,92,96,0,2,Shenango River Trail,Intermediate,3.5,"        This is a nice and enjoyable trail when the brush is clear, but more often than not it isn't. Every so often a group clears it aggressively, but the brush regrows just as aggressively.

Start at either end, Kidd's Mill or Big Bend. It's generally easy to hike and follow at the start, but sooner or later the thick brush takes over. There are sections that are very wet, depending on how the rain has been, and there are many obstacles and large fallen logs to climb over. It is easy to get lost, but the important thing to remember is that it was once a towpath. So the trail will ideally hike along the manmade ridge next to the canal pools, much like the raised railroad bed of a rail trail.

From New Hamburg, the southern section is generally much more clear.

Mostly level river trail with a few dips for stream crossings. No engineered features, but many natural obstacles such as roots, mud, and loose sections. One old pipe crosses the trail at shallow angles.

Stream crossings are frequent and vary greatly in difficulty. In some cases, the mud is surprisingly deep and can lead to some difficulty navigating through. Make sure your shoes/boots are tied tightly!

The trail splits frequently for horses one direction and foot traffic the other. Follow the horse direction to ford a stream, or the hike direction to cross a narrow bridge with railing.

1.6,Point to Point,1489,1196,315,40,4,18,Glacier Ridge Trail - Trout Cove Alternate,Intermediate/Difficult,3.5,"        This section of the Glacier Ridge Trail/North Country Trail is another alternate route that takes hikers along the bank of Lake Arthur before climbing up a hill and descending to the Route 528 Trailhead.

The trail is easily located at the eastern terminus where signposts signal the trail split. Slightly harder to identify at the western terminus, the trail spurs off from the GRT/NCT without any significant signage.  Possibly the easiest way to remember that the trail splits is by using Lake Arthur as the marker. Nowhere else on the GRT/NCT does the trail get so close to Lake Arthur. So, keep this in mind. You'll descend what will seem like the 4th or 5th significant hill, and arrive at Lake Arthur, but the trail will turn and head up a hill within 2 minutes (.1 mile) after reaching the lake. This is where the trail splits, and if you stay along the banks of Lake Arthur, you'll have linked into this alternate route.

This alternate is really nice, providing a change of pace and scenery for the first half of the trail. Finally out of the woods, you'll have the lake and fisherman dotting the banks. However, you'll eventually turn north and climb over 1 mile to the top of the hill before linking back into the GRT/NCT trail.

Even though its in the middle of the city, the path seems pretty rustic and secluded and gives you a pretty nice view of the Wissahickon Creek. When you get to Rittenhouse Street, you'll turn left back to the Historic Rittenhouse Town parking lot.

The trail is best east to west and seems to get slightly easier in that direction as well. The beginning is a jumble of rocks that you'll have to navigate. 

The trail intersects with several trails that traverse between Hunter Rd and Henstep Valley Trail, so there are always options to shorten your hike. The intersections themselves aren't always marked, but its pretty clear that you want to stay on the ridge and keep following the trail on the spine itself. 

There are a few rock outcroppings along the trail to keep it interesting. At the end, the trail drops off a little steeply, so watch your footing.

The northern trailhead has a singletrack dirt entrance and is easily seen from the Spring Hollow Trail.

Starting from the southern trailhead, hikers will immediately start to climb the hill. Once at the top, the trail weaves through the regenerating forest. It should be noted that the trail may be hard to follow as the foliage is not dense, and little undergrowth is present. As hikers make their way across the hilltop to the northern end, there is steep descent back to Spring Hollow Trail.

During this first portion of the trail, keep an eye out near where the Colonial Spring Trail branches of to the west. There are interesting ruins of what used to be a bottling company that are still mostly intact. Peeking through the trees to see the remains of the buildings is exciting for visitors of all ages. 

After passing the intersection with the Horse-Shoe Trail, continue back eastwards until reaching the creek again. Follow the creek on this essentially flat trail as in hugs the eastern flank of Mount Misery.  The short and relatively steep Wolfinger Trail heads west uphill.

This section of the NCT follows the Glacier Ridge Trail, and shares the bright blue blazes. In general, the trail is well-groomed, but there are sections of loose rock and larger rocks that slow your pace. 

Heading north/east, the trail starts by taking you over Hidden River Bridge before crossing the bike path and N. Shore Drive. Once over the road, you start the first of many climbs. Continue following the blazes over several roads, around one small pond, and past the marina on your way to the end of this section at Route 528, near the bridge crossing over Lake Arthur. 

Once you cross Route 528, you'll be presented with a 300-foot climb to the top of a ridge, which offers a nice view of Lake Arthur in fall and winter when the leaves have dropped. There are several stretches of open space as you climb which also give glimpses of the lake. The next 5 miles are similar to the first 8. You'll make 3 climbs along singletrack trail which is primarily smooth with occasional sections of loose rock. You'll recognize the end of the trail when you reach the Jennings Environmental Center and a uphill slope of flower beds. The NCT continues on to Allegheny National Forest, and all the way to the New England states, but Jennings Environmental Center marks the end of the Glacier Ridge Trail.

Note, if you head south from the bike shop parking lot, the trail continues for approximately a mile before dumping hikers out at the intersection of Burnside Road and W. Park Road. The NCT continues to McConnell's Mill State Park using Burnside Road and Johnson Road. In McConnell's Mill the NCT follows the Slippery Rock Gorge Trail.

The vegetation is sometimes overgrown here, especially in later summer. Most trails can be used in both directions. The section that parallels the Allegheny River is on the ridge, so be careful. 

There are plenty of parking opportunities and you can drop in on trails in numerous places. The park has running water except during the winter months.

Red blaze trail is nicer when hiking in a counter-clockwise direction, as the downhills are longer and mellower. Many other trails that connect to this one so you can string loops for a longer hike.

Mostly a mix hardwood forest, some areas of evergreens, and an occasional field.

Using this trail in either direction is fine. The opening from Mohn Mill has a gate to go around, and the opening from Gap Road is next to the telephone pole. The trail entrance on that side isn't very wide in an effort to reduce hoof or quad traffic. This trail is blazed in red.

If you go straight, you'll be hiking the Mountain Mist Trail. 

After a little while, you'll arrive at another intersection. Here, this trail is crossed perpendicularly by the Mountain Mist Trail. Keep hiking straight if you want to follow the Musser Gap Trail.

If you decide to go back, you could go to your right (following the Mountain Mist Trail). This path will take you to the second intersection that you encountered before, forming a mini-loop. CAREFUL HERE! Following the Mountain Mist Trail requires you to turn right at some point (it's marked but you might not see the entrance). You'll know that you have missed the turn to the Mountain Mist Trail if you see the signal that says ""No hunting, trapping, hiking is permitted before this point"".

To continue on the Musser Gap Trail, continue to follow it through the intersection with the Mountain Mist Trail to reach the trail's end in a junction with the Mid-State Trail (MST).

The trail winds along dirt and grass sections. Because the trail is lightly traveled, the grass sections may not be as obvious, but there is little room to move as you are often between the road and Squaw Run in those grass sections.

You'll cross a ""wood"" arched bridge right before the end of the trail. From the bridge, you'll hike along grass first on the right side of the road, and then left side, crossing at the intersection. The trail ends at the following intersection.

1.2,Point to Point,119,89,29,32,1,3,Walnut Hill Impoundment Basin #21 Berm,Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail starts near the intersection of the Commissary Trail and Sulivan Street.  Just before you reach Sullivan Road at the end of the Commissary Trail, look left for an unnatural looking berm rising up.  (It will be between a small footpath and a larger footpath with yellow posts).  

Ascend the berm and you'll find yourself along the top of a wall built to impound water pumped from the Schuylkill River. The berm was created as part of the first large scale river cleanup effort in the United States.  In the Late 1940's and early 1950's, Pennsylvania and the Army Corps of Engineers dredged and cleaned the Schuylkill River in an effort to remove large amounts of polluting coal silt.  This wall is part of Impounding Basin #21, built to contain the large amounts of coal laden water that were removed from the Schuylkill River.  Inside the basin is a large stone weir which allowed silt to settle and water to return to the river.

Atop the basin is a small footpath.  Aside from a slight grade at the entry point the remainder of the trail is level.  There is a lot of understory growth including thorns to navigate along the way.  The remnants of this berm end at the Commissary Trail

When I was there in late fall, there was not much dense underbrush, and you could see pretty clearly throughout the woods which are mostly deciduous. There were some laurel as well. The trail is primarily soft dirt with occasional rockier sections. The trail is marked with green blazes and accessible from a few points within the park, including the Scotts Run Lake area, making it a good connector or start to one of the many other blazed trails in the area.

The trail can be accessed from several trails: Chestnut Path, Laurel Trail, Cabin Trail, Bridle Path, Waterfall Connector, or the Butterfly Fields. 

The trail begins by passing a stone structure missing a roof and much of its walls, with grass and vegetation growing all around it. Once past the house, the trail makes a very steep dip to a stream bed. There are small trees to grasp as you descend, but hikers should take care not to rely too heavily on them as this could potentially damage the trees.

It is also worth noting that there is a stream crossing near the beginning that can be challenging when the water is high.

Tebolt Trail Intersects the Hess Trail near the trailhead parking area. If your hike starts at the parking area, you'll descend the steep section of the Hess Trail, which can be a wake up call because it is moderately steep and rough due to an abundance of small rocks.

It has several rocky sections, but is not as difficult as other trails nearby, the trail can be used as a bypass or shortcut for the hillier Switchback Trail, Ridge Trail,  Boulder Trail and Boulder Bypass, which it connects to.

Done in the direction shown, it's a slight upward grade. The trail starts as a smooth, straight section off the end of the Lower Spanky, then crosses an old abandoned road and a powerline cut, and enters a wooded, stone-armored section. After picking up the Boulder Bypass, it enters a swampy area, with corduroy and bridges to get through the wet parts.

At the fork in the trail, take the left onto what looks like a tall grass path (right takes you onto Hunters Ridge Trail). The path rises up a small slope leaving behind the grass.

The trail winds its way around the hillside, providing mostly manageable trail with a few instances of tall grasses obstructing view of foot placement. Hikers will pass by a ""trail"" of sorts at a distinctive intersection. There are two options; straight takes you to the connector trail, and right keeps hikers on Adams Run Trail. Adams Run Trail begins its descent to the game land dirt road. To connect back with the campground, make a left on the dirt road and look for the Lowlands Trail sign on the right.

Note: The connector trail is a grass hillside with yellow blazes, but no trail visible. Moreover, the hillside is a water runoff, making it sloppy and not very easy to hike.

Turn to the right at the first intersection (before reaching the large seasonal pond in front of you).  Follow this path as it wanders through the remains of a large retention bond built to hold back coal laden sediments dredged from the Schuylkill River in the late 1940's-early 1950's. The trail will work its way back out to the gravel road portion of the Commissary Trail near Sullivan Road and the River Trail.

It begins at a dirt road with a confusing name. Some maps refer to it as Biesecker Gap Rd., others Snowy Mountain Rd., and another as Forest Rd. The trail is approximately 200 feet north of where the AT crosses the road. Look for a yellow gate. There is a small pull off parking area nearby.

3.0,Point to Point,1802,1437,377,493,6,11,Old Green Ridge Road,Intermediate,3.0,"        This easy-to-follow trail begins as an old doubletrack logging road. After approximately one mile, it passes through a clearing that has been dubbed a wild turkey habitat project before re-entering the forest in a singletrack fashion. Shortly, the trail begins to climb, reaching gradients in the 8-12% range for three quarters of a mile until it tops out in a clear-cut/nuke zone that is particularly unattractive. 

The last stretch is on a gravel road to the terminus at Rattlesnake Run Road. I took it in January and the winter views were nice, if unspectacular.

In this section, it passes over a beaver dam and its reservoir.  

There are many butterflies and dragonflies in this area.  After it leaves the boardwalk, the trail follows a gravel path that is very well maintained. Finally, it transitions into the grass and passes a group of cabins until it meets its terminus at Cabin Colony Road.

Starting from Bear Meadows Loop heading south, hikers will go up a moderate incline to an intersection with section 8 of the Mid State Trail. About 25 yards after the intersection is a smaller campsite with a fire ring on a charcoal flat.  

The descent down to Wampler Road is generally pretty thick with Mountain Laurel. There are a few other potential campsites on small charcoal flats, though not as large as the first campsite closest to the Mid State Trail. About 0.25 miles before Wampler Road is Gettis Spring to the west of the trail.

Miller Road, that extends from Laurel Summit Road to the intersection with Silvermine but is gated just beyond. Beyond the gate the trail is a more distinctly doubletrack with grass down the middle.  

Part way between the gate and Bobcat Trail is a link connecting this trail to the Wolf Rocks Trail, which would allow you to hike the easier middle section of Wolf Rocks Trail in combination with Spruce Flats Trail rather than the road. If Wolf Rocks Trail is your sole destination, there is a parking area adjacent to the beginning intersection.  If you are using this trail to access the south segment of Black Bear Trail, the intersection there is indistinct.  

This trail also provides access to the only designated State Forest campsite (#1) in the Park. Reservation info can be found at  apps.dcnr.state.pa.us/fores… .

3.9,Point to Point,791,719,125,184,1,9,Lake Shore Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        The Lake Shore Trail is considered the most scenic trail in Little Pine State Park, running along the lake into the upper valley of the park.

Using the Little Pine Creek dam as its starting point, the route heads out across to the other side and then turns left. Here, it enters a wooded area along the lakeshore. There's a bit of a climb followed by a descent, taking you to the nesting area of a pair of bald eagles.

Keeping your eyes peeled, continue on to a beautiful valley beyond the lake. You'll arrive at the loop section of the hike here. Either way, there's a climb and descent. As you make your way around, you'll be in a mix of open areas and wooded forest.

Once you've completed the loop, head back toward the dam on rolling terrain that climbs back to the beginning of the hike.

Beam Run Trail descends from the parking spot along a wider corridor that is poorly drained at the upper end. Although the trail may appear to continue straight as you pick up speed on the descent, it takes a sudden sharp left turn, onto narrower singletrack. The turn is not as difficult to see coming the other direction.  

The rest of the trail is rocky, consisting mainly of rounded embedded boulders rather than the smaller more abrupt stones encountered elsewhere.

From the west, the trail starts at the Audubon Hawk Watch parking lot.  A short side trail leads from the TT up talus slopes to overlook with good views south across the Cumberland Valley.  

Past the Hawk Watch, the trail enters the F.J. Reineman Wildlife sanctuary and proceeds east along the northern bench of the mountain.  This section of trail is particularly rocky.

The trail eventually comes to a junction with old Longs Gap Road and bears north onto in and descends (to the south, the road leads a short distance to good views of Cumberland Valley).  Near the base of the mountain, the TT bears east off-road and ascends back to the northern bench of the mountain.

Just before bearing north and descending along the power line cut, the trail passes a talus slope with good views to the south.  At the base of the mountain, the trail bears east of the power line cut onto dirt road near a cabin and proceeds to PA-34 (Spring Road).

Starting at the Arrow Island Trail South Parking Area off National Park Dr., travel north along the Arrow Island Spur and turn left at the junction with the Arrow Island Trail. Follow the Arrow Island trail (heading west) for a short while until it reaches a T intersection with the Slateford Loop Trail. 

At this point, visitors can hike whichever direction they choose, taking note that this trail is a series of two loops joined by a central connector. Those wishing for a shorter excursion can remain on the eastern loop, while those wishing for more time in the woods can hike both loops. 

While on trail, keep your eyes peeled for the remains of a bygone slate quarry and a historic farm which both exist today as weathered, brown structures. The trail is somewhat rolling, but not overly strenuous.

If you're taking the larger of the two loops, note that you may have to navigate a small portion of the southern extent on a little-used portion of National Park Drive.

The trail is a mix of narrow singletrack and some sections of doubletrack that starts with a steep climb from the west before it levels out through the forest and clear cuts higher up.

Visitors to the trail have the option to park at either the southern parking area off National Park Drive, or the northern parking area off Route 611 near the Arrow Island Overlook.

Starting at the southern parking area, follow the short Arrow Island Spur to a junction with the Arrow Island Trail. Continue right along the trail, keeping your eyes peeled for remnants of the vibrant cultural history embedded in the forests along the Delaware. 

Back in the beginning of the 20th century, numerous hotels and tourist attractions were located along this stretch of river. 

If you're lucky, you just might see the remains of two different periods of occupation along the trail: first a series of old farm fences, and second a collection of stone supports that once upheld a raucous casino. 

Lastly, bring your eyes up to the towering cliffs above the trail for an exciting peek into prime peregrine falcon territory. For those with access to a pair of binoculars, this trail presents the perfect opportunity to use them! 

Upon reaching the trail's end, hop across the road to the Arrow Island Overlook for stunning views of the Delaware River and Arrow Island.

20.7,Point to Point,296,79,687,531,1,5,Perkiomen Trail,Easy/Intermediate,2.7,"        This 20-mile trail follows the Perkiomen Creek from Oaks (at the Schuylkill Tr to Green Lane Park).  The trail is mostly crushed stone with a few paved paths.  The majority of the trail is wide enough for several people to hike alongside each other.  

The trail begins at  the Schuylkill Tr in Oaks. but there is no parking at this point.  There is a parking lot for Lower Perkiomen Valley Park on Mill Rd,(on trail, but 1 mile from S end). Entire section from parking South to the Schuylkill Tr is paved.  In this section, there are picnic tables, fire pits, and pavilions.  There are athletic fields used for organized soccer and ultimate events.  This section is wooded with cut grass undercover.

To the North, the trail and creek cross under Egypt Road Bridge and follow the Perkiomen upstream.  For approx 1 mile, the trail remains a wide paved surface.  When this large surface reaches Upper Indian Head Rd (the first road encountered, and blocked with yellow bollards), the trail turns left/away from the creek.  It will follow road briefly until a gravel path on the right approximately midway up first rise.  Go right as the path dives through some wooded areas.  This next section will be a mix of crushed gravel path and hard pack dirt/rock path.

There will be two hazardous road crossings.  Each crossing carries the trail at an angle across the road somewhat in a hill section of the road with limited sight distance for drivers.  Although the crossings are well marked, traffic generally moves quickly and drivers may not heed the trail signs.

After these two crossings, there are few hazards.  The remaining road crossings are either protected with signals or have plenty of visibility for trail users and drivers. The trail passes through Collegeville in the form of sidewalks and paths between buildings.It passes close to a brewery, a diner, and several other dining options.  North of Collegeville, a large portion of the trail is paved until it reaches Central Perkiomen Valley Park, another picnic and recreation facility with parking bathroom facilities.   The Skippack Trail offers a side trip to the Village of Skippack.

To North, trail is mostly crushed gravel with some pavement. It passes old Mill House, Pennypacker Mills Historic Site, and Green Lane Park, offering swimming, boating, and camping facilities.  Visit  montcopa.org/index.aspx?nid… for camping, boating, fishing and more trails in Green Lane Park

1.8,Point to Point,1555,1390,218,250,5,19,Noels Trail,Difficult,2.5,"        When traveled from east to west, this is a challenging, rocky singletrack with some sharp, quick climbs. If the technical sections don't wear you out, the climbs will. Once you hit the powerline, follow that down the fire road all the way to right before the end where it goes up a little bit and comes out onto Sulphur Springs Rd.

When utilized from west to east, it is a fireroad climb to the powerline and then a rocky technical downhill to Shaffers Trail.

4.4,Point to Point,749,637,134,104,1,6,Lakeside Trail,Difficult,2.5,"        Start at the Bald Eagle Launch in Howard. The trail goes through a heavily wooded area with lots of  creek crossings and rock gardens. It remains within 20 ft or so of the lake shore on the way out (but views of the lake are limited by the heavy growth). The trail is a flattened lollipop shape. 

The second half is a loop that follows the lake edge on the way out, crosses under the train tracks and continues through the woods, paralleling the train tracks back to Park Rd. Follow Park Rd for a few hundred yards to get to the crossover back under the train tracks to connect with the first part of the trail. Retrace your steps on the first half of Lakeview Trail to return to the parking lot.

If you like rocky trails then this one if for you!

The southern entrance has a small tube with gravel spread over it. Enter and head up a small hill and enjoy the singletrack through the dip. You'll run into an intersection in an open grassy area, where a long forgotten trail used to meet. While the trail has been abandoned, its remnants remain. Stick to the well defined trail downhill, and you'll soon be on your way! 

This trail then intersects with Schuler Woods Trail. Go right to Remington Access Road or left toward the stone bridge.

It's pretty much all doubletrack but it runs like singletrack. This trail has some slow grades with some slight downhill mixed in. It travels from covered tree areas to some open, sunny areas, and back and forth. Once you get to a split, stay right to continue on ""Lower Middleton"" or slight left to go ""Upper Middleton Road"". 

Once you take the 90 degree turn it climbs up a bit then you come to a dirt road called Sunnyside Road; head down that to go back, or turn around and go back the way you came.

42.7,Point to Point,1180,722,1124,1030,1,7,Montour Trail,Easy,2.3,"        This rail trail technically connects Coraopolis with the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP) in McKeesport; although, a section is under development around Jefferson Hills.  

The trail itself is a mix of cinder and paved path. It gently climbs the first 10 miles to the foot of Robinson Town Center. From here's the trail dips and dives, never at more than a 1% grade, through the South Hills. 

The trail offers access to Panhandle Trail, which brushes by Settlers Cabin State Park, and the trails at South Park (South Park Connection to Montour Trail).  

For access to GAP trail:
Unfortunately, the trail is incomplete past South Park. To continue to McKeesport, hikers will need to follow Piney Fork Road making a right at the current southern/eastern trail terminus. This will take hikers through a narrow tunnel before a 4-way intersection where the rail trail picks up again on the road's edge. After a quarter mile, hikers will cross Gill Hall Road, ending the roadside rail section, and follow Peters Creek Road for roughly 3 miles. After crossing route 51 and staying on Peters Creek Road, hikers will find the Montour Trail East section dipping into Clairton. 

In Clairton, make a right on North State Street and cross Clairton-Glassport bridge. Follow Ohio Avenue north making your way through Glassport and eventually over the 5th Ave bridge into McKeesport. Most of this section is over bike shared roads with sidewalks available. The full length of Montour Trail to McKeesport is around 60 miles.

There are a few intersections, just don't turn onto any that are marked no trespassing; they will lead you to the reservoir which is a no trespassing zone. 

Once you get to the steepest descent towards the end, start looking out for a gate that goes across the road. After that, there is a tough climb out of the hollow that will put you back to the top of Remington Access Road.

This trail is affectionately known as ""The Mud Trail"" for a reason. The section nearest Remington Access Road has had some drainage culverts installed and is in decent shape. The Quarry Trail exits on this dryer portion and is often traveled.  The portion that connects to Raccoon Trail is a perennially wet trail.  

Not often used, but fun if you want the mud. In winter, a nice frozen connector.

1.5,Point to Point,147,104,76,71,2,7,Upper Schuylkill River Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        NOTE:  This portion of trail is not associated with the longer-distance Schuylkill River Trail and not part of that system. This may become an alternate path for the longer trail, but the official Schuylkill River Trail is located on the Chester County or western side of the river.  Instead, this trail is part of the proposed ""Schuylkill East Trail"" which would be a similar long distance trail. Though this section is complete, the longer trail is still in progress (or possibly just in planning).

This trail follows the Schuylkill River on the Montgomery County side of the river. From the parking area at Lock 60 Park, cross the small footbridge over the canal and turn left. Go past the gate and follow a small footpath upriver.  

In the beginning, this will be a grassy path. Along your left there will be the remnants of moorings for the canal and an older generating station. At the upriver end of the canal is Black Rock Dam, which is about 1/3 mile into the route. 

Depending on river levels, it may be difficult to proceed beyond the dam. Normally, the far right edge of the dam is exposed and passable. From here, the trail becomes more gravel/rock bed and narrower with a few spots of mud and small water crossings. At the upriver end of the trail, you'll come to Upper Schuylkill Valley Park and Wildlife Center operated by Montgomery County. There is also a picnic and parking area here.

2.6,Point to Point,205,90,145,90,2,12,Audubon Loop Trail,Intermediate,2.0,"        Start the trail from the parking lot at Lower Perkiomen Valley Park. From the parking lot, head back on Mill Rd towards Egypt Road. The trail crosses over the Perkiomen Trail and Perkiomen Creek on the Egypt Rd Bridge. After crossing the bridge, look for bollards denoting where the path passes through a wooden fence. 

The trail passes through a meadow offering opportunities for birding and wildflower observation before crossing the Mine Run (bridge). Here, the trail enters a wooded area and begins a steep ascent. A few marked side trails are off to the right following Mine Run into the Perkiomen. As the trail levels out, the remains of an old copper and lead mine will be on your left, (with an interpretive sign). The paved trail continues on and reaches the edge of a large field. As the trail turns a corner, a large bird blind is positioned facing the field. 

If you wish to visit the Museum (Audubon's house) and Raptor Center (next to the house), follow the dirt path across the field and turn to the right. You can return to the loop trail by following the driveway until it crosses the trail just before exiting the property at the corner of Audubon Road and Pawlings Road. 

The paved loop trail continues around the edge of the field and turns to follow Pawlings Road. The trail runs alongside Pawlings Road for a bit. On the non-road side of the trail look for more birds and forest restoration activities (and more interpretive waysides). There will be one short descent and climb when the trail crosses Old Mill Road. The trail continues on to cross US 422 via the Pawlings Rd Bridge (concrete barriers isolate the trail and vehicular traffic, fencing prevents leaping from the bridge). 

The trail joins the Schuylkill River Trail - Conshohocken to Parkersford at the Pawlings Road Trail Parking area.

At the turn, head straight down the trail that seems to go straight when the road turns left.  This will take you down to the Skippack Creek.  While the trail might be poorly marked, if you follow the creek you'll eventually end up at an area to turn left.  If you miss this, you'll get to the bridge.  If you cross the bridge you'll get onto the Skippack Loop Trail.

Heading left, you'll go uphill to Lesher Rd. to the point where it becomes abandoned.  From here I would turn around if just doing this trail, or head down to the end of Lesher to cross the road.

If you are feeling brave, head left to the end of this trail.  There is a very deep stream crossing in which you'll either get completely soaked or get stabbed by thorns finding a way around.

To the East of the turnpike bridge (NPS Boundary), the trail is approximately 1 vehicle width mowed path through grassy fields. The trail follows Valley Creek across from Lafayette's Quarters.  

Just south of the Knox Farm, the trail crosses Valley Creek.  This crossing is designed for horses, at low water it is passable by bike, and when flow is low enough, it could probably be done on foot (although there is a foot bridge just a little farther ahead on Knox Trail).  Once on the East side of Valley Creek, the trail backtracks a little upstream to an abandoned forge before turning East across a field heading towards the ""Airplane Field"" (AKA ""Archery Field"").  This field hosts a model radio controlled airplane club.  In 1969, Valley Forge park hosted the first World Archery Championships held outside of Europe.

1.9,Point to Point,1199,1127,73,118,2,9,White Blaze Red Dot,Intermediate,2.0,"        This is a nice loop that starts at the archery practice area. It can connect to Lost Boy - White Blaze Black Dot trail or White Blaze. It starts out as doubletrack until it crosses the White Blaze where it becomes singletrack. 

Use caution as this trail is frequented by more hikers and dog walkers than most of the other trails.

3.7,Point to Point,2019,1044,1022,47,6,62,MST - Section 3 Bypass,Intermediate/Difficult,2.0,"        This portion of the MST follows unmarked PA Route 26, on sidewalk and well past where sidewalk ends, eventually crossing through an industrial park.

Begin climbing a ridgeline while crossing through the industrial park where orange blazes begin. Watch carefully for blazes around Blue Triangle Hardwoods' active log loading yard. Continue on past a dirt Game Land parking area (drivers have to go through the log yard!) and climb more steeply, eventually passing through the Scully Squeeze rock formation. 

From there, continue on upwards, and make your way over large boulders. Meet the MST proper on the top of the ridge. The Blue Triangle-Scully Squeeze portion of the trail will become the main trail once the route is open to Everett's Tenley Path - see  hike-mst.org/index.php/guid… for updates.

While this route isn't the most scenic portion of the trail, it is the preferred way to make your way through urban Everett.

1.1,Loop,1249,1108,137,145,5,12,Orange Loop,Intermediate,2.0,"        The trail is accessed from the Hartwood Acres Purple Loop near the mansion parking lot.  Starting south you'll follow the purple loop for a few hundred feet before jumping across the road/walking path and continuing the Orange Loop.

The trail is smooth with a dip into a valley and a climb back out but not terribly challenging.  You'll poke out of the woods for a brief period, and on a hot summer day it feels like jumping into and then out of a furnace.

Connected to the Orange Loop is the White Loop.

0.4,Point to Point,1142,913,0,229,10,16,Beaver Dam Path,Difficult,2.0,"        The Beaver Dam Path trailhead is found among spruce trees along the aptly named Spruce Run. The trail runs steadily downhill for nearly two thirds of its length before running head on into Bog Run. This is a tricky spot, as the natural flow of the trail would have hikers continue straight; however, to continue on Beaver Dam Path, take the hard right. This final third of trail is steep and runs within a washout full of 1' diameter boulders. The trail ends at Trout Run.

While the red loop circumnavigates the hill, the green loop takes you to the top and back down in just a mile of trail.  The trail is typical to Western PA.  It has some roots, mainly dirt, and after a rainfall can become slightly slick and hard to scramble in one area in particular.

1.0,Point to Point,2790,2696,96,11,2,4,Loop Trail,Easy,2.0,"        This trail begins as a gentle singletrack, which can be muddy at times, just north of the warming hut at a signed entrance. The middle section shares its doubletrack alignment, and the single small hill, with Interstate Trail.  Shortly beyond the top of the hill, it branches off to the left on a wide singletrack that crosses Bill Albert's Trail and connects to Lippo's Loop Trail. This section is smooth graded for groomed cross country skiing, but is a good introduction to hiking in the woods.

The warming hut is open 24/7 to provide shelter from inclement weather, including a wood burning stove for heat.  Pit toilets are adjacent.  No overnight camping.

Hikers will pass a gate, cross Babb Creek on a road bridge, and begin following the narrow dirt South Elk Run Road. There is a three car pull off on South Elk Run Rd, about 100 yards north of Arnot Road. Do not park on Arnot Road - there is no shoulder, and it is a narrow road with tight curves and an angry landowner.

Note, just before the end of the road is an intersection with the Gravel Path on the left, and an unmarked trail leading to the Butterfly Fields.

The Bridle Path is a tricky trail starting with a descent before a short climb and the final short descent to Waterthrush Way.  While considered separate trails, they are alike in trail surface, which is a mishmash of old concrete and loose stone.  Moreover, soil and vegetation has begun to grow in areas. This has left both trails in an odd situation where hikers will have to deal with uneven and constantly changing surfaces.

0.3,Point to Point,1140,1126,10,16,2,3,Laurel Trail,Easy,1.0,"        The trail is a semi-loop, running along the hillside. The trail is accessed from the Bridle Path at either end, and also connects with the Waterfall Trail. The view of the valley floor is mostly hidden, but some thinner areas of underbrush allow for a brief view down the hillside.

There are not many rocks on the trail, although there are plenty of roots to make up for it.

The park is tranquil, featuring pavilions and picnic locations. For your after lunch hike, head out on this short, but perfectly shady trail. Along the way, you'll enjoy meandering past Core Creek, which burbles past as you hike. 

Once you complete this short loop, you can extend your outing by continuing on to the main Core Creek Loop, or you can head back to your picnic spot for a rest.

This location, where Dr. Henry Cowles conducted much of his early work in plant ecology and succession in the early 1900s, remains an important focus for scientific study today.

Explore several distinct habitats along this 4.7-mile trail including ponds, marshes, swamps, black oak savannas and beaches. Steep sand dunes near Lake Michigan make this a very strenuous journey. Many visitors pack a lunch to enjoy at the shoreline while resting for the return trip (dont forget to pack out your trash). Make sure to bring plenty of water and sun protection.",IN

The savannas native grasses and wildflowers, including lupine, thrive in the sunlight and more open forest floor. The wild lupine, the only food for the caterpillar of the endangered Karner blue butterfly, grows close to the trail. Please stay single file on the narrow trail to protect yourself from the abundant poison ivy along the trail edges as well as the fragile lupine habitat.",IN

The trail boasts 1,500 man-made steps spread out fairly evenly over the course of the trail, and allows hikers to see the best parts of the park by joining Trail #3, Trail #4, Trail #5, Trail #9, and Trail #10, into a single loop. The trail visits the Coal Mine, the Narrows Covered Bridge, Lusk Home, the Punch Bowl, Camel's Back, ""140"" steps, Boulder Canyon, Falls Canyon and many stream crossings, making the approximately six-mile hike very worthwhile.

Tolleston is the second youngest of four distinct dune systems found within the national park. Together these dune ridges provide a glimpse into the changing shoreline of Lake Michigan. Older dunes, like Tolleston, are found farther inland from Lake Michigan's present shoreline and were formed thousands of years ago when the lake was much larger than it is today. 

In winter, this trail is a popular spot for cross-country skiers looking for a more challenging experience.",IN

Hike for about one mile down Tincher Ridge before falling off into the Rock Shelter Hollow. See many rock outcropping and a large ""rock shelter"" before climbing out to a high ridge. The trail follows mostly ridges until it drops and crosses Low Gap Loop Road. 

Cross the road and enter the Backcountry Area of Morgan-Monroe State Forest. There is a camping area located near the road. Cross a couple of nice bridges before climbing to the top of Gourley Ridge. Drop again into an isolated valley filled with creeks and pine forest. Depending on the season, wildflowers, wildlife, birds and fungi can be observed. 

Climb out of this hollow and head along a fringe of trees with a logging road. Turn left for Low Gap Loop (Tecumseh Trail turns right) and follow the logging trail to Low Gap Road. Cross the road and continue down/up the gravel road which turns back into another logging trail. 

Follow this trail past Indiana University Hardwood Ecosystem study (look for the tubing and buckets) until it turns to the left. From there, the trail runs just south of the main forest road back to the parking area. Look for pileated woodpeckers on this section. 

Overall, this is a very nice trail with some isolation, especially in the backcountry area.

The actual trail is only ~0.6 miles long, but the loop totals one mile when the necessary jaunts along the road and West Beach Trail are factored in. From the parking lot, follow the road north, toward the lake and look for the trail to pick up to the west of the bathhouse. 

This scenic, but strenuous, trail includes a climb up 250 stairs for a spectacular view of Lake Michigan and Chicago. Support the restoration effort in the fragile dunes and ponds, or pannes, by remaining on designated trails.

The main trail is not accessible to wheelchairs. However, there is a paved road from the parking lot to the bathhouse that offers views of Lake Michigan that is accessible to wheelchairs. The main parking lot has spots for 596 cars and is open year round.

There are restroom facilities and potable water available year round in the West Beach Contact Station. Seasonal showers, lockers and a lifeguarded beach are available from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend.

Indiana Dunes National Park (formerly national lakeshore) was established to preserve portions of the Indiana Dunes and other areas of scenic, scientific, historic and recreational value. Up to two million annual visitors enjoy the park's 15,000 acres of wetlands, prairies, sand dunes, oak savannas, forests, and historic sites. The park's 15 miles of beaches hug the southern shore of Lake Michigan from Gary, IN, to Michigan City, IN. For more information, visit  nps.gov/indu/index.htm or  facebook.com/IndianaDunesNPS.

The first half of the hike is on flat to rolling trail in the forest. The footing is good with a mixture of sand and packed dirt. The trail is never crowded, even on summer weekends. 

At the furthest point east, the trail will turn north and climb over a steep vegetated sand dune. Footing is loose sand. Once to the lake, the trail back to the beach Pavilion runs along the beach. The beach is amazingly pristine. Take plenty of water as this hike will take longer than it appears due to the loose sand.

22.9,Loop,861,409,3374,3370,6,27,The Adventure Hiking Trail Loop,Intermediate/Difficult,4.3,"        The trail is rough, rugged, and rutted in places, with a number of steep climbs and descents. Fallen trees, logs, and loose rock may be encountered at any time, as the trail receives minimal maintenance. 

The trail is marked with white and green markers. Some markers can be difficult to locate, especially in places where trees have fallen.

Beginning in the campground, near the entrance to the Horseman's Camp loop, follow the gravel access trail a short distance down to the Adventure Hiking Trail intersection on the right. 

The trail descends approximately one mile toward the Blue River, crossing the Breeden Ridge Trail, before dropping into the river valley and crossing the old Iron Bridge Road. (The trail runs through the bottom lands near the Blue River, and the area can be wet or closed during high water events.)

Following the edge of the Blue River for a mile or so, the trail climbs back up the ridges and crosses the Fire Tower Trail in two locations before descending again toward Fox Hollow, eventually climbing back up the hills for a view of the Blue River, near the trail intersection at Rendezvous Point. Just across the river is the old Stagecoach Campground.

The trail continues across a series of ridges and valleys for about 3 miles and after another descent, the trail climbs once again as it nears IN-462, and crosses that road a short distance from the O'Bannon Woods State Park entrance.

After crossing IN-462, the trail winds through a swampy area, and then once again descends through a rocky segment following a dry creek bed, before climbing again. The trail continues to twist and wind, with a number of shorter climbs and descents before a long climb to the Old Forest Road crossing. It's about 2 miles from crossing to crossing.

From Old Forest Road, the trail drops and climbs again, and joins a horse trail for a short segment along a ridge line. The trail breaks off and continues to wind through the woods before reaching the steep limestone bluffs that overlook Indian Creek far below. The trail follows along the edge of the bluff closely, before reaching the Indian Creek Shelter a short distance later.

From the Indian Creek Shelter, the trail descends and climbs a number of times, through rocky creek beds and up short hills, approximately 3.5 miles before reaching the Old Homestead Shelter.

Another series of short climbs is followed by long descent to the Cold Friday Road crossing, about 1.5 miles from the Old Homestead Shelter. The Cold Friday Road crossing is an excellent place to cache supplies, or leave a vehicle in case of an emergency.

From Cold Friday Road, the trail climbs up a steep rocky hillside, and makes a steep descent into a dry creek bed, before climbing steeply once again up a sharp switchback step. Following along the edge of another ridge, the trail descends and climbs once more, before reaching a long, scenic section that runs along the edge of the bluffs overlooking the Ohio River. The trail joins a horse trail for a short distance before reaching the Ohio River Overlook Shelter. It's about 2.8 miles from Cold Friday to the shelter.

From the Overlook Shelter, the trail makes a twisty mile-long descent toward Potato Run Creek and follows along a steep bank overlooking the creek. The trail crosses Potato Run Creek near the Pioneer Shelter and crosses the paved park road, climbing up a steep bank on the opposite side over a series of water bars.

The trail continues to climb the ridge and twists and winds through a series of short descents and climbs before eventually crossing the Breeden Ridge Trail. After crossing Breeden Ridge, the campground is a short distance away, with the trail joining the gravel access trail the hike began on.

It starts with a tough, steep climb up to the rim of the quarry, then levels out for the remainder of the trail. This particular trail is great for trail running or hiking, but regardless of how you enjoy it, you'll want to take in the views as they are beautiful.  Nearly the entire trail follows the rim of the old rock quarry, so you'll be treated to a expansive vantage point of the whole quarry from anywhere you are.

5.7,Loop,662,573,247,246,2,12,Perimeter Loop,Intermediate,5.0,"        This is GBP's longest loop; follow the red shield ""Perimeter Loop"" blazes. Starting near the main parking area, the trail heads north through the forest before reaching a climb; the trail follows a wider trail NW along the lake. The trail turns north to a long section punctuated by switchbacks; a climb brings hikers to one of the park's tallest hills. 

After a descent, cross a bridge and then turn left. Follow along a pond, cross bridges and a short cobblestone section and then meander through the woods. After crossing another bridge, the trail passes over a few undulating bumps and then climbs out to a right turn. 

Here the Perimeter Loop joins the doubletrack dirt Moore Road that is followed for about a mile to a singletrack trail situated along the park's southern boundary. Take in gorgeous views of Stryker Lake before reaching the SW parking lot. The trail continues across the lot and follows short ridges with dips in-between. The trail then straightens out and leads to some switchbacks before ending near the main parking area.

This is a very popular area for mountains bikers. Be aware of your surroundings and of other users on the trail.

2.0,Loop,670,507,229,226,4,25,Trail 4,Difficult,5.0,"Trail 4 can be accessed from a few spots throughout the park. For our hike we took Trail 1 from behind the Spring Mill Inn to reach Trail 4. You can also access the trail from the parking area near the Pioneer Village. 

The trail takes you to many historical elements of the park. The Pioneer Village is a historical recreation of what life was like in this area in the 1800's. Log cabins and the working grist mill our manned by interpreters are open for you to explore. Upon approaching the Pioneer Village, you'll have two choices to continue your hike. One portion of the trail will take you thorough the village, and the other way takes you around the village. NO DOGS are allowed in the village, so plan accordingly. 

Just past the Pioneer Village, you'll pass Hamer Cave and eventually come across the Hamer Pioneer Cemetery. The path follows the back side of the cemetery along the fence. You'll need to work your way around to the front to access the cemetery if you wish to explore there. Be on the look out for grave markers identifying servicemen who fought and died for our country.

After the cemetery, you'll cross through a parking and picnic area and descend a long series of wooden steps taking you down to the creek. From here you can turn right for a very short spurt to Donaldson Cave. Turning left at the bottom of the steps completes the loop and takes you past the Wilson Monument honoring Andrew Wilson an early American ornithologist. The monument was erected in 1866 by George Donaldson, the former land owner.

You'll come across many hills and valleys and will be met with many rock formations that you'll need to work around on this trail. The park map calls this trail ""rugged"" and it lives up to it's classification.

1.8,Point to Point,668,542,311,259,6,21,Trail #2,Difficult,5.0,"        Most people park at either Newby Gulch shelter or the Nature Center for this trail. When parking at the Nature Center, take the 70 Steps Connector down to the bottom of the canyon. Turn left on Trail #1 until Trail #2 branches to the right.

Once on Trail #2, you'll enter Box Canyon, one of the most underrated canyons at Turkey Run. This canyon feels like trekking through a tropical rainforest in the summertime and is worth checking out. The trail climbs a stone staircase carved into the rock and is truly a sight to see. At the top, multiple pathways emerge and it can be difficult to determine which one is the trail. Continue straight, and the trail should become narrow again and bank to the right.

The trail now follows the canyon rim and dips down into the valley where it hugs the rock wall. Eventually you'll come to Gypsy Gulch, another underrated landmark at Turkey Run. The trail continues to hug the wall here, and sometimes a waterfall will form in the middle of the gulch which can be walked behind. After passing the gulch, the trail passes more interesting sandstone cliffs before meeting the Lusk Earth Fill Connector. Turn right and follow Trail #2.

The rest of the trail is pretty flat and traverses forest and a road before passing Canyon Shelter, some picnic areas, and some parking. The trail returns to the rock staircase, completing the loop. This trail is typically less trafficked, making it a nice trail to get away from the crowds at Turkey Run.

0.4,Point to Point,586,517,84,84,7,16,Trail #6,Difficult,5.0,"        This is a very short trail that is crammed full with landmarks and things to see. I recommend this trail to everyone who pays a visit to Turkey Run State Park and I highly suggest trying this trail in the evening when the canyon gets cold and the crowds go away.

The start of this trail is behind the cabins near the Turkey Run Inn. After passing the cabins, the trail heads down into Turkey Run Hollow. Passing under the Old Highway Bridge, the trail follows the creek around a bend traversing boulders and small caves. About halfway, the trail meets with Trail #7, which is another underused but fantastic trail at Turkey Run. Trail #7 turns left, while Trail #6 continues to the right.

After crossing a bridge, the trail splits and goes to a small beach along Sugar Creek. Swimming is not allowed here, but it is a nice secluded spot to watch the river. Turning to the right, the trail continues by climbing up to Sunset Point, overlooking Sugar Creek from above. Nearby is the Lieber Cabin, which typically houses a few historical exhibits about the park and the area. Trail #6 finishes behind Turkey Run Inn.

Users will pass the foundation of a CCC cabin at the base of the climb. A steep climb and technical features like multiple rocky sections, logs, large step-downs, bridges, and tight switchbacks make Hesitation Point a very interesting trail. 

The challenging climb brings you to the parking area at the overlook. Be sure to snap a few photos here, especially in the fall, before descending again. Hesitation Point connects with the Walnut Trail, which begins at this parking area, just on the other side of West Gate Rd.

The trail is designed as a set of back and forth dips with some tight turns and fun ups and downs. Toward the front half of the trail, there are two large jumps for mountain bikers. 

The back half of the trail gets a bit more technical with roots and rocks where you'll want to watch your step. This is a really fun part of the Franke Park Trail System.

2.3,Point to Point,863,627,205,277,4,12,Fire Tower Trail,Intermediate,5.0,"        The Fire Tower Trail begins just off the parking lot at the base of the old fire tower and runs to the Class A Campground. Look for the wooden entrance gateway. 

The trail starts with a smooth, downhill, curvy segment weaving through a large hardwood forest, with numerous creek crossings and drains to be aware of. As the trail approaches the bluffs overlooking the Blue River, users will encounter more rocky conditions before arriving at a short rock feature that spans a wet area along the steep cliff side. This attention-demanding segment of the trail continues along the edge of the bluff for a short distance before reaching another smoother, easier section. A side trail on the right leads to a scenic overlook.

After a gradual climb to the Iron Bridge Road crossing, the trail continues to twist and turn and descends into a series of curves, toward a wooden bridge and an intersection with the Rocky Ridge Loop. Proceeding up the left fork at the intersection, Fire Tower Trail leads to the campground, the Potato Run Trail and the Breeden Ridge Trail, while a right turn will lead into the Rocky Ridge Loop. 

The trail twists and winds through another section of rocky limestone outcroppings before climbing to the other intersection with the Rocky Ridge Loop. Proceeding left at the fork, Fire Tower Trail continues to climb toward the campground, where water and restrooms are available. 

The Potato Run Trail is accessed by hiking a short distance to the left up one of the campground roads. The entrance is near the ice machine, by the campground gatehouse.

2.0,Point to Point,741,576,43,166,2,7,Rocky Ridge Loop,Difficult,5.0,"        The Rocky Ridge Loop joins the Fire Tower Trail in two locations. Traveling downhill from the Fire Tower, the first intersection is just a short distance past the wooden bridge. 

At the signpost where the Fire Tower Trail meets the Rocky Ridge Loop, taking a right at the intersection will lead down Rocky Ridge, toward a rugged, rocky, rooted section, before descending into the neighboring ravine, crossing a typically dry creek bed. After a long climb, the entrance to the Breeden Ridge Trail will be on the right.

Taking the fork to the left, the Fire Tower Trail slowly climbs toward the Class A campground, through a scenic, rocky segment, where large limestone boulders line the edges of the pathway. 

At the next intersection, water and restrooms are available in the campground by taking the left fork, continuing up the Fire Tower Trail. Taking the right fork, following Rocky Ridge, the trail will lead to the Breeden Ridge intersection. 

After a short downhill and crossing a wooden bridge, the trail begins a long rolling descent through the woods. Part way down the trail, a fork to the left will lead to the Breeden Ridge Trail. Further down the trail, after a series of twists and turns, the trail transitions into a rocky and rooted section, following along the edge of a steep-sided ravine. After crossing a typically dry creek bed, the trail continues a rough, rugged and sometimes narrow climb. 

Watch for the rock ramp just when it almost seems like the trail has disappeared. Continue up a rocky climb, over a bridge and through the woods. A left turn at the trail intersection will return to the Fire Tower after a long, mostly uphill climb. A right turn will lead back to the campground.

The Group Camp Trail begins by weaving through the fallen pines, with poison ivy all along the edges. The hand-cut trail follows along the edge of a gentle ridge, past the raspberries and log hops, before crossing a horse trail. 

After crossing the horse trail, the Group Camp Trail begins to descend into a rugged, rocky, challenging section that follows along the edge of a deep ravine. The trail makes a turn just after a dry creek crossing, crosses a cobblestone minefield and continues along the ravine, past many limestone outcroppings, through a series of switchbacks and along a rocky, rooted segment, before reaching the Group Camp area. 

The trail winds through the woods, through a series of rollers around the Group Camp, before ending at the paved road. The entrance to the Potato Run Trail is just across the road.

Starting near the 56th Street entrance and moving to the east, the trail takes you toward the Indianapolis Rowing Club HQ. From there, you traverse a small peninsula before moving back into the woods and passing the Earth Discovery Center (a wonderful stop of educational opportunities and exploration!) From there, the trail takes you toward the marina. 

The next part of the trail is really exciting with a modestly steep drop in elevation before you head out on a narrow strip of land that surrounds a bird sanctuary. Lots of people like to hang out on this strip of land to fish. Sometimes the water level is so high that the southern strip of land can be nearly submerged. Once you complete the loop around the Bird Sanctuary, the trail climbs in elevation to the top of a BEAUTIFUL overlook through a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees. at this point, you start to turn to the southeast and head toward the 71st Street entrance. At this gate, there is a restroom should you need a break. 

From here, the trail takes you along the fitness trail (large/wide/flat) before swinging by the Ornithology Center. Stop by to take a look at the gorgeous hawks! Then, the trail takes you to Lily Lake (great picnic spot) with another restroom opportunity. Moving south, you'll cross 62nd Street and head toward the ice skating pond. Just south of the pond, you'll go back into a deeper wooded area near the main road that runs north-south through the park (Eagle Creek Parkway). The trail ends at the parking lot where you began (and another restroom facility).

The trail parallels a rock-bottomed stream for a while and then continues through the stream channel to a natural rock shelter. 

A singletrack switchbacks up from the stream bottom and passes a small forest pond that's a great place to see frogs and the occasional turtle. At the trail junction, turn left to complete the 3.3 mile Rock Shelter Loop or turn right to continue on the 10-mile Low Gap Trail. The singletrack merges onto another fire access road that returns to the trailhead parking area.

The trail switches back and forth and includes many small streams. It is very well maintained with some signage and bridges over the streams. Bikes on this trail are expected to ride one-way while hikers can go either direction. If you take the trailhead to the left from the parking area, you'll be hiking into the bike traffic and will be able to see them coming towards you. The other direction will have the bikes coming up behind you.  As Ft. Harrison was formerly an army base, you'll also see some large concrete structures and footings from building long gone that remind you of the historical significance of the area.

If you want to hike this loop by itself from the main trailhead, the total round-trip distance is 2.4 miles. You'll start and end the hike using a portion of the West Beach Trail. 

The footing is mainly loose sand. This area is being restored as an oak savanna and is a great place to see prickly pear cactus. The trail follows along Long Lake and then heads into the dunes. There is a great view of long lake after the initial climb. After crossing the entrance road, the trail winds through the undulating dunes and then has a steep climb down an exposed dune to the picnic area.

The trail is not accessible to wheelchairs. However, there is a paved road from the parking lot to the bathhouse that offers views of Lake Michigan that is accessible to wheelchairs. The main parking lot has spots for 596 cars and is open year round. 

There are restroom facilities and potable water available year round in the West Beach Contact Station. Seasonal showers, lockers and a beach (with lifeguards) are available in the summer. 

Indiana Dunes National Park (formerly national lakeshore) was established to preserve portions of the Indiana Dunes and other areas of scenic, scientific, historic and recreational value. Up to two million annual visitors enjoy the park's 15,000 acres of wetlands, prairies, sand dunes, oak savannas, forests, and historic sites. The park's 15 miles of beaches hug the southern shore of Lake Michigan from Gary, IN, to Michigan City, IN. For more information, visit  nps.gov/indu/index.htm or  facebook.com/IndianaDunesNPS.

This trail can be a loop if combining with with other trails, or it can be out-and-back if you're wanting a short but still rugged hike. 

About halfway through Trail 5, you'll see a sign that points you one of two directions: to Trail 4 or to continue with 5. We continued and did the loop at the end. This is a great area for those who like seclusion; it was a grown up area that had us feeling like we were deep into the forest. If you're just going down Trail 5, there are about 100 stairs, if you're going down and back up, get ready for 200! That's why this trail is rated Difficult, even though the distance is just about 1 mile. 

Depending on the water levels, you'll pass through the creek a few times. Pick up an interpretive brochure as there are numbered stops along the way to learn about the trail and species that inhabit it, including the Yellowwood tree!

The trail begins at the Pioneer Shelter and crosses Potato Run Creek, which is usually dry. Follow along Potato Run and climb up, following along the steep-sided bank overlooking Potato Run Creek. 

The Cliff Dweller Trail forks off to the left after a rugged climb, but local hikers typically tie Cliff Dweller into a hike up to the Ohio River Overlook Shelter (AKA Lloyd's Cabin), on The Adventure Hiking Trail Loop for a great view of the Ohio River, before returning to the trail intersection.

The descent from the intersection crosses a number of rocky ravines before dropping through the cedars. Use caution on the descent, as the trail drops off sharply over a rocky outcropping, followed by a hard left turn. The trail then follows along a rocky creek bed, climbing and descending another rocky outcropping before returning to the Potato Run crossing. Follow the trail up the hill, back to Pioneer Cabin.

Breeden Ridge begins with a classic hand-built segment leading into a rocky section with a number of optional lines. Past the rocks, the new machine built trail begins, with a rolling climb to the top of Breeden Ridge. A stair-step segment through the rocks leads toward the top of the ridge.

Once at the top of the ridge, the trail twists, and winds, with a number of berms and rollers, and descends through a challenging, rocky staircase toward more berms, rollers, and rock features. The trail climbs toward a small woodland pond--the highest point on the trail. From the pond, a series of twisting turns leads into some mountain biking features, before reaching a horse trail crossing.

Past the ridge line horse crossing, the trail begins to descend toward Potato Run, with another series of features popular with mountain bikers, as it drops down into the valley. 

Use caution while approaching the horse trails, and yield to horseback riders, if present.

With a twisting climb up the other side of the creek, the trail begins to level out, with another series of bike features, before joining the Potato Run Trail.

A left at the trail junction will return the user up Potato Run toward the campground while a right turn will allow the user to continue toward the bottom of the Group Camp Trail.

Follow a stretch of the Little Calumet River, once a critical transportation route for early regional travelers, and explore the recently restored Mnok Prairie for a glimmer of the vast stretches of pre-settlement grasslands. 

Visit the Bailly Homestead and Chellberg Farm to glimpse how families lived and farmed in Northwest Indiana. 

The Bailly Homestead, a National Historic Landmark (1962), was the home of Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774 - 1835). Bailly played a role in the development of the Calumet Region of northern Indiana. He was an independent trader in the extensive fur-trading network that spread from Montreal to Louisiana, and ultimately to Europe. Joseph Bailly was one of the earliest settlers in northern Indiana. In 1822, Bailly set up his fur trading post at the crossroads of several important trails. The Bailly Homestead complex is the last remaining site of its nature in the Calumet Region.

In the 1870s, Swedish immigrants Anders and Johanna ""Kjellberg"" bought 80 acres to establish a modest family farm. They were the first of three generations of the Chellberg Family to make their living here. In the 1930s, the Chellbergs started to tap the many maple trees on their property for the production of maple syrup.

The Annual Maple Sugar Time event in March (first 2 weekends) features the evolution of ""maple sugaring"" in Northwest Indiana from an early American Indian method, to the pioneer method of boiling sap in open iron kettles, to the relatively modern commercial method of producing syrup. Indiana Dunes National Park is the only National Park Service location that makes maple syrup.

There are 3 covered picnic shelters near the parking lot that are wheelchair accessible. The shelters are reservable at recreation.gov starting six months in advance of the desired use date. Cooking fires at the picnic shelters are permitted in the provided grills or an approved carry-in grill. An approved grill is a noncombustible container with an enclosed bottom and enclosed sides with a minimum depth of 2 inches. Charcoal must be cooled and safely disposed of in a noncombustible container or removed from the area.

The trail initially follows a very rutted and often muddy horse trail that can be uneven even in the wintertime when the previous season's muddy furrows have frozen over. Fortunately, several of the most heavily disturbed sections of trail have been bypassed singletrack that is designated with ""hiking"" signs.

Because the trails follows along a gentle ridge, it isn't very strenuous, especially compared to the nearby Pate Hollows trails. Eventually, the trail turns into all singletrack with an awesome hillside overlook of the lake before it descends more steeply toward the edge of the peninsula.

Along the final leg, the trail is shored up by timbers to help combat the swampiness. The last descent brings hikers to the rocky shoreline of Lake Monroe where some nearby lakeside houses are visible. This is a great spot to enjoy lunch or a swim before heading back to the trailhead.

With a couple of steep uphill climbs and descents along washed out terrain, this 2.2-mile trail is scenic and secluded, while also offering a bit of a challenge. One of the more difficult trails in the state park, this trail will definitely get you winded in some spots, but isn’t so tough that you have to be an expert to complete it. 

It starts at the firetower, which also is something fun to do in the park (if you can make the climb up the stairs, the view from the 90-foot structure is worth it). 

After hitting the trail, you'll hike along a wide, straight path before meeting a split in the trail. Stay to the left to continue your hike. Next, you’ll approach a steep descent, which levels out at the bottom. A couple more small ascents and descents, and you’ll discover a little pond about one mile in. Shortly after, the trail will become more washed out as you encounter a steep descent into the trail basin. 

At your lowest point, around 1.3 miles in, you’ll cross a creek bed before beginning your ascent out. Get ready for a pretty tough uphill climb for a couple tenths of a mile before the trail flattens out. Then, it’s time to climb again until you reach the Shelter House at mile 1.9. Catch your breath and take a break before wrapping up the trail with one more moderate climb that will take you back to the initial split. Once there, it’s smooth sailing until you reach the end.

The fall colors will make up for the lack of the overlooks if you happen to be visiting in September-October. The right timing here will give you awesome colors to enjoy.

This trail is open for mountain biking and horse riding, so it's a good idea to keep your eyes and ears open for other trail users. The south parking area is rather small but the north parking will handle plenty of cars and those with horse trailers. The published trail info warns about rattlesnakes but we didn't see any on our outing.

two gas pipeline cuts in the first half mile, neither particularly offensive. Keep an eye out for the USFS signs on the opposite side of each cut. 

The trail then rolls along the ridge to the ""peak"". You'll find some dinner table sized rocks, just past the peak on the left (south) side of the trail. These are the Hominy Mortars, rumored to be a place where natives ground corn, but likely just some neat holes in the rocks. Turn around and follow the trail back for a 3.5+/- mile total.

2.1,Point to Point,469,450,68,67,1,4,Lake Trail,Easy,4.0,"        This trail winds around Lake Lincoln, following the shoreline and crossing the dam. It's mostly a dirt trail and, given its elevation relative to the lake, can get fairly muddy in the wetter months. That said, the park has built elevated wood platforms through the worst of it, making it manageable even in the muddiest conditions. Along the back end, there are a few steep grades for only a few feet, but it may be enough to make it difficult for some people. 

One of the highlights of the trail is that it is the access trail to the Fire Tower Trail. The fire tower is one of the highest point in the surrounding counties, allowing you to see for miles in every direction and providing some excellent views. Taking this trail will add some distance and increase the difficulty due to much steeper grades and several flights of stairs up the tower, but it is quite worth it.

After beginning the trail near the Abe Martin Lodge, you'll hike down a few stairs before reaching the beautiful State Park amphitheater. Shortly after, you'll start your descent toward the Saddle Barn. Upon reaching a T in the trail, take a left to continue your hike downward. Another set of stairs and you bottom out at the Saddle Barn, where you can pop over for a closer look at the horses if you like. 

Follow the signs across the gravel road, a grassy area, and the paved road before picking the dirt trail back up. Head into the woods again for a slow, steady ascent. The trail will then flatten out a bit before making its descent into the valley. Climb up a flight of stairs and the trail will level out again, offering scenic views of the valley below. 

You’ll then cross a wooden bridge over a creek about 1 mile in. Now, it’s time to begin your ascent to the top. During this time, Trail 3 will intersect with Trail 2 around the 1.3-mile mark. Keep heading up toward the Lodge, climb a few more stairs, and then you’re done!

A great trail for anyone, especially families, Trail 3 is easy with plenty of things to check out and discover along the way, including the Abe Martin Lodge, the amphitheater, and the Saddle Barn!

The northern site's GPS coordinates are [39.056727, -86.317730]. As you turn sharply west toward the cemetery, there's a narrow (usually soggy) trail spur going north to this location. It's far enough off the trail that passersby will likely not notice you there. This ""secrecy"" is somewhat reinforced because the spur is not marked on current maps, though there is some signage.

The unnamed creek usually has water, and will occasionally feature small waterfalls. After you go under some power lines, the trail moves uphill on the right. This is the biggest hill on the trail.

Once at the top, this trail is mostly flat from here on. You'll pass a small pine forest, and eventually come to some cropland. After that, you'll once again go underneath the same power lines, where you can hear them buzzing. Around here, the Templeton Creek Trail veers to the left, while the Fairfield Trail continues to the right. The trail ends at the parking lot for the Glidewell Trail.

5.8,Loop,849,792,176,185,1,8,Bendix Woods County Park Bike Trail,Easy,4.0,"        This singletrack trail is designed for mountain biking, but hikers can also enjoy the nearly six miles of wide twisting trail if they hike in counter-clockwise against bike traffic as mapped.

The casual trail has lots of twists and turns but minimal obstacles as it travels through old growth forests on the north and west sides of Bendix Woods County Park. Along the way, it intersects with the Raccoon Run Trail and crosses over active roads at several points, so be on the lookout for other trail users and cars.

The local bike club NIMBA does a great job keeping the trail edges trimmed and cleared of fallen limbs or trees and the trail typically dries out faster than other local trails after a rain. 

The park has an entrance fee / annual pass that you can buy, although 90% of the time the park is open with no fees required. The fee is only charged on days when an attendant is manning the park entrance. If there is an event going on, then it is likely someone will be manning the entrance and collecting the entrance fee. Otherwise, hikers will find a sign reading ""No Fee Today.""

From there, head south and follow an unmarked but well-trod trail to an exceptional overlook of the Big Walnut. Continue on until you see a fork in the trail. The loop starts here and can be taken in either direction.  

If you like to climb stairs, go left; if you prefer to climb on trail, go right. Going right, the trail wanders along a ridge and then heads down to the creek on a series of wooden stairs. This next part can get a little tricky, depending on water levels in the creek. You'll see the remnants of stairs across the creek. You need to get across to continue.  

Follow the path as it crosses the creek a couple more times. You'll find a sign pointing to the Tall Timbers Trail Spur, this takes you down to the banks of the Big Walnut. Once you've had your fill of this, return on the spur to the junction, and go right, over the boardwalks and up the hill.  

As you come out of the steepest part of the climb, keep an eye out for a small carved rock on the creek side of the trail.  Follow the trail out, and you'll be back to the loop junction shortly. While you're in the area, there is a fantastic covered bridge just down the hill from the parking lot.

1.6,Point to Point,960,765,128,204,4,13,Glidewell Trail (Long Loop),Intermediate,4.0,"        This trail intersects the short loop near the unnamed pond. At the intersection, head south (away from the cropland) and immediately hike down a steep hill. At the bottom, the trail follows the shore of Brookville Lake. This trail sits on a peninsula jutting out into the water, so throughout this portion of the trail are wide, scenic views of the lake. Around 0.70 miles in, the trail begins uphill, and stays mostly uphill until the trail meets up again with the short loop. Follow the gravel road to the right to return to the parking lot.

A common route people use for this trail is to start on the short loop, turning right soon after leaving the parking lot. Upon arriving at the pond, taking another right onto this trail, and finishing out on the gravel road. The entire route is about 3 miles, intermediate difficulty, and passes the mound, the pond, and winds along the lakeshore. This is the most scenic route.

From the campground, the trail begins near the ice machine, sharing access with the Tulip Valley hiking trail. At Battleship Rock, the trail splits off to the right and heads along the ridge behind the campground, before descending into the valley. Use caution when approaching the horse crossing and yield to horseback riders.

After the horse crossing, the trail crosses dry creek beds and runs through the spicebush and hardwood, and over an old rock fence line, before entering a series of machine-built twists and turns. A spur trail on the left will lead off toward the nature center.

The trail continues to wind down toward the intersection with the Breeden Ridge Trail, and then winds along the edge of Potato Run before crossing the creek bed.  A short climb from the creek leads toward an access road to a lift station and the Group Camp Trail. Again, caution should be used, as the trail crosses another horse trail before reaching the road.

If you are scared of heights, this is a pretty terrifying bridge to cross. I wouldn't recommend children on this trail simply because this bridge is very treacherous and the rest of the trail sits atop a very high ridge. The trail itself is not dangerous; just be aware of how high you are and keep your kids within sight.

After crossing the bridge, the trail turns to the right and ends in a clearing. In this area there is an old log church, and a memorial to Colonel Richard Lieber, the father of Indiana State Parks. Return to the start of the trail by retracing your steps.

The tunnel is very fun to hike through, though be aware it is pitch black halfway through, and there is a small waterfall and pool on the inside.

The preserve is part of the Valparaiso Moraine, which was formed by the last ice age. The nature preserve contains a combination of rolling ridges, steep hills, and ponds. The trail is surrounded by a beech-maple forest. There are excellent wildflowers in the spring and migrational birding in the spring and fall.

This trail is popular with overnight campers at marked and unmarked campsites. The beginning and ending legs of the trail receive the heaviest traffic because of the campsites and the graveyard, but your company quickly thins toward the middle of the trail.

Hike through a forest dominated by maple, beech, basswood, and oak trees. Follow a stretch of the Little Calumet River, once a critical transportation route for early regional travelers. Explore the recently restored Mnoke Prairie for a glimmer of the vast stretches of pre-settlement grasslands. 

Visit the Bailly Homestead and Chellberg Farm to glimpse how families lived and farmed in Northwest Indiana. 

The Bailly Homestead, a National Historic Landmark (1962), was the home of Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774 - 1835). Bailly played a role in the development of the Calumet Region of northern Indiana. He was an independent trader in the extensive fur-trading network that spread from Montreal to Louisiana, and ultimately to Europe. Joseph Bailly was one of the earliest settlers in northern Indiana. In 1822, Bailly set up his fur trading post at the crossroads of several important trails. The Bailly Homestead complex is the last remaining site of its nature in the Calumet Region.

In the 1870s, Swedish immigrants Anders and Johanna ""Kjellberg"" bought 80 acres to establish a modest family farm. They were the first of three generations of the Chellberg Family to make their living here. In the 1930s, the Chellbergs started to tap the many maple trees on their property for the production of maple syrup.

The Annual Maple Sugar Time event in March (first 2 weekends) features the evolution of ""maple sugaring"" in Northwest Indiana from an early American Indian method, to the pioneer method of boiling sap in open iron kettles, to the modern commercial method of producing syrup. Indiana Dunes National Park is the only National Park Service location that makes maple syrup.

It's really nice having these two optional routes at the beginning and end of your hike so that you can adjust your distance easily. If you take Pine Loop to North Gate Trail then continue up to the top of the hill at North Tower Loop, it's about 1.7 miles vs. 1.1 miles if you take the North Gate Trail directly.

The trail can be accessed year round, and it has some steep inclines and declines.

Starting off on its namesake ridge, the trail traverses gentle grades through the woods to the end of the ridgeline, at which point it dives sharply into the drainage below. From here, the trail follows the gentle upslope of the drainage through pristine forests before climbing back up the ridgeline to its end. From its end, take a right to follow a stretch of trail from earlier back to the trailhead and the Taylor Ridge Campground.

The trail has some water erosion, but is wide enough to hike alongside. A few creek crossings down in the valley can be challenging after a heavy rain. The trail occasionally meanders part ways up the side of the hill and affords some nice elevated views of the creek below. Eventually the trail rises up and weaves through an old pine grove before meeting with the Foxy Hollow Trail about 1 mile from the trailhead. Continuing south on the fire tower trail, you'll cross another gravel road, and then arrive at another fork in the trail in about 1.3 miles. The fork to the right (southwest) will lead you to the campground. The fork to the left (southeast) continues down into another valley where the trail meets the Twin Lakes Trail. Just before meeting the Twin Lakes Trail is a wide, shallow creek crossing that may lead to wet feet if unable to find enough stepping stones.

The trail is well marked with red rectangular blazes.

1.3,Point to Point,885,828,85,139,3,26,Lakeshore Trail,Intermediate,3.5,"        This is one of the longest trails in Whitewater Memorial State Park and begins at the parking area near the Hornbeam Nature Preserve. From the parking lot, follow the signs into the trees. The first part of the trail includes a half mile loop via the Lakeshore Trail Alternate. You can choose to go left or right since both directions will eventually take you to the longer portion of the trail that follows the edge of the lake. 

Throughout this trail, you'll be hiking through Indiana woodlands with some hills and valleys that will take you near the water's edge for most of the trail. Shortly after the loop, there is a very short segment that will take you down to the water's edge. This is a great spot for a picture or just to watch the activity on the lake. As you continue from here, you'll be able to see various waterfowl. Plus, be on the lookout for small turtles and frogs sunning near the shore.

As you approach the end of the trail, you'll come to a wooden staircase that takes you down to the observation deck at the end of the trail. Depending on the time of year, you'll be able to see some views of the lake, but be advised the observation deck is at lake level but not actually on the lake. It is surrounded by trees, so your view may be blocked during the warmer seasons. While here, take some time to catch your breath and keep an eye and ear out for the various species of birds found in this area. From here, it's time to turn around and head back to the parking area. I personally like trails like this as you get to see the whole trail from both perspectives, coming and going.

9.7,Point to Point,758,710,112,65,0,6,Fall Creek Trail,Easy,3.3,"        This trail starts at North Meridian Street, but most will use it as a branch off the Monon Trail, where it departs immediately after crossing Fall Creek. There is a short leg that continues east, but the length of the trail goes west following Fall Creek until reaching Fort Benjamin Harris State Park. 

This is a paved urban trail running through a greenway as it cuts through the city of Indianapolis. The trail is great for running, hiking, and biking, though there are a few places which can be muddy after a rain.

1.5,Point to Point,771,732,56,58,1,7,Hathaway Perimeter Loop,Easy/Intermediate,3.0,"        This trail is shaped a bit like a lollipop, which means that a short way down the trail from the parking area is a fork. We went to the right to start our way around the loop. 

The first part of this trail goes through the woods and is more difficult than the other 3/4 of the trip. There are pretty views and it's only a moderate trail, not too strenuous, to the first waterfall (approx. 1/4 mile in). There are twp potential creek crossings depending on water level. The creek isn't too wide and we were able to cross in winter without getting wet (the second crossing had more water than the first). 

After about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile you'll be out of the woods and on to the wide and mostly flat grass path through a fairly young pine grove. There is a short boardwalk through a small wetlands area around mile 1. To shorten the outing, you could cut across one of the connector paths to make a shorter loop. The paths and trail are well maintained (at least they were clear in the winter) and easy to follow. I highly recommend not missing the first part of the trail if you are at all interested in the views!

1.2,Point to Point,683,453,102,235,5,18,Green Blaze Trail,Intermediate/Difficult,3.0,"        The Green Blaze Trail is a camp favorite that, while small in length, is big in trailside spectacles. Mainly, this trail leads to the camp's underground waterfall (a sub-surface expression of water that is viewable through a ""skylight"" in the ground above).

Starting at the Parking Area, the trail heads east through picturesque Indiana hardwoods on a leafy tread until reaching a junction with the White Blaze Trail. Make a right at the junction to continue on the Green Blaze Trail, climbing gently out of the woodlands for a brief moment to skirt the edge of a field. After diving back into the woodlands at the end of the field, the trail traverses the same woods from before, now heading downhill, for a short distance before popping out onto a doubletrack road. As quickly as the trail joins the road, it both dives back into the woods and increases in steepness drastically. Upon reaching the road for a second time, the trail offers great views of the lake and a great spot to enjoy some water or a snack.

When you're ready to continue, the trail makes a sharp left turn to climb gently along the banks of Big Run. With roughly half a mile of creekside trail (which is actually only running after heavy rains or flooding), you'll have plenty of time to enjoy its pleasant company. After rejoining the White Blaze Trail briefly, the end of the trail is met with its most interesting feature: the underground waterfall.

Cascading under the surface, this waterfall is only visible through a small opening in the ground that's partially covered by rocks and detritus. Further adding to its novelty is the lack of visible water anywhere else around it, and the large hills to its sides. For those that know a thing or two about groundwater, this can be an interesting spot to give a lesson to those uninitiated.

Once you've enjoyed the waterfall to your heart's content, you can either return the way you came, or you can jump onto the White Blaze Trail to extend your pleasant experience in these Indiana woodlands.

The Hobart Prairie Grove preserves several habitats including wetlands, prairie remnants, white oak flatlands, and a rare bur oak savanna. At about 300 acres in size, it contains 343 native plants and an abundance of wildlife. This area is also noteworthy because of a unique soil that is made up of at least 70 percent silt and clay with the smaller portions of sand. This type of soil is one of the reasons for the outstanding diversity of life here at Hobart Prairie Grove.

To get a better view of Donaldson Cave, take the connector to Trail 4 and hike down to see the cave.

Passing the connector to the Inn, the trail crosses two more roads before going through more dense forest and returning to the parking area for Twin Caves.

1.3,Loop,693,668,45,43,1,5,Inner Loop,Intermediate,3.0,"        1.4-mile singletrack close to Purdue University.  Nestled between the golf course and Cherry lane.  Small parking area at the trailhead and/or about 200 yards away from a paved trail that runs from Purdue to West Lafayette.

The trail is generally clear as it was built for easy biking. As such, there are few roots and rocks.  A few small hills provide a bit of work and the continuous winding keep your attention.  The south side of the trail can be muddy after rain.

This is a nice beginner trail or a quick hike at lunch time.

0.5,Lollipop,903,816,100,99,8,20,Lookout Trail,Intermediate,3.0,"        Lookout Trail starts from the playground across from the Studebaker pine trees. It is easy to find. The trail surface is packed dirt with leaf litter. The first part of the trail is easy to follow as it travels along the side of Carlisle Hill. At the south end the trail comes upon the maple syrup operation with a sugar shack. In the late winter, there is an amazing web of plastic tubes that run from each tree to larger lines and eventually to the sugar shack. The trail will turn to the right and head up the hill. The path was difficult to follow until the well-worn rut was found that has clearly been used for decades.

Take the trail to the top of the hill. Try to imagine that this was once an operational downhill ski area from 1969 until 1986. There are remnants of the rope tows and and an alpine slide that never opened due to safety concerns. Finish the trail by heading north down the front of the hill back to the playground.

Its northern terminus is off Cornett Rd. near its intersection with W. County Road 760 N. The trail heads to the west where it crosses Callahan Branch and climbs over the ridge, then descends to cross Callahan Branch again and intersect with Hickory Ridge Trail 14, Hickory Ridge Trail 15, and Hickory Ridge Trail 17. 

It climbs steeply out of the valley, reaches its highest point just before it loops back towards the east, crosses a pipeline right-of-way, gradually descends, and intersects with Hickory Ridge Trail 17 again at its southern terminus, near the eastern terminus of Hickory Ridge Trail 17.

The trail surface is packed dirt with leaf litter. The trail will split almost immediately into several trails. Take the right onto the Big Tree Trail. There is a sign post. The trail will wind through a climax beech / maple forest with interspersed tulip poplars. The trees are very large with a nice open understory. The trail will pass the junctions for the Lower Big Tree Trail as it turns to the north. The trail ends at the junction with the Raccoon Run Trail. It is recommended when taking this trail to add Lower Big Tree Trail to the outing.

Bendix Woods County Park was once owned by the famed Studebaker Automobile Corporation. 840 acres were purchased in 1926 and became the first automobile proving grounds in America. Various road conditions were simulated to test their cars. Although it was a testing facility, Studebaker maintained the grounds as a natural area. In 1938, they planted 8,000 pine trees that spell the their name ""STUDEBAKER"" when viewed from the air. You can still see it today on the map above running north-south. The trees were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The proving grounds were sold to the Bendix corporation in 1963, which in turn donated 195 acres to St. Joseph County to establish the county park. The rest of the acreage is still being used as automotive proving grounds today. Bendix used the grounds until 1996, selling it to Bosch who then sold the land to Navistar in 2015.

Bendix Woods County Park was once owned by the famed Studebaker Automobile Corporation. 840 acres were purchased in 1926 and became the first automobile proving grounds in America. Various road conditions were simulated to test their cars. Although it was a testing facility, Studebaker maintained the grounds as a natural area. In 1938, they planted 8,000 pine trees that spell the their name ""STUDEBAKER"" when viewed from the air. You can still see it today on the map above running north-south. The trees were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. 

The proving grounds were sold to the Bendix corporation in 1963, which in turn donated 195 acres to St. Joseph County to establish the county park. The rest of the acreage is still being used as automotive proving grounds today. Bendix used the grounds until 1996, selling it to Bosch who then sold the land to Navistar in 2015.
